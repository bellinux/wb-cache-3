40|$|Oil palm {{is one of}} the {{important}} plantation crops in the plantation sector. Increased oil palm plantation area causes the need for the availability of oil palm seedlings in large quantities. Good quality oil palm seedlings were obtained through intensive maintenance especially fertilization. Fertilizers needed for the growth of oil palm seedlings include calcium and magnesium fertilizers. The objective of this experiment was to determine the optimum rates of calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>fertilizer</b> for oil palm seedling (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.). This experiment was conducted at Cikabayan Experimental Station, IPB Darmaga, Bogor, from December 2011 to November 2012. The experimental design used was factorial randomized block design with three replications. The first factor was Ca fertilizer rates i. e., 0, 5, 10,  and   20 g CaCO 3 plant- 1. The second factor was Mg fertilizer rates, i. e., 0, 24, 48,  and 96 g MgSO 4  plant- 1. The results showed that calcium affected stomatal density, whereas <b>magnesium</b> <b>fertilizer</b> affected morphological and physiological variables (stomatal density and chlorophyll content) of oil palm seedling. Based on the plant height and stem diameter, the recommended rate of <b>magnesium</b> <b>fertilizer</b> for 8 months oil palm seedlings in the main nursery was 58 g plant- 1. This total rate should be applied at different amount every month from 1 - 8 month, at 2. 0, 2. 0, 8. 0, 9. 3, 8. 8, 9. 3, 9. 4 and 9. 3 g MgSO 4 plants- 1, respectively.

Five years after continuation of treatment application, soil samples were taken from top soils (0 - 20 cm) and sub soils (20 - 40 cm) at monthly intervals for 10 months and analyzed for exchangeable potassium and magnesium (1 M ammonium acetate extraction at pH 7. 0) and water soluble potassium and magnesium (1 : 10 soil/water ratio). Leaf samples taken from the 14 frond at bimonthly intervals were analyzed for potassium and magnesiu [...] The results showed that the application of potassium fertilizer decreased the quantity of both exchangeable and water extractable magnesium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>fertilizer</b> decreased the quantity of exchangeable potassium in soils. The mutual decreasing effect on the exchangeable fraction of each nutrient is attributed to low cation exchange capacity and base saturation of the soils.

30|$|High loading: it {{suggests}} {{that the quality of}} groundwater is mainly controlled by high loading parameters. The high SO 4 2 − is related to the long-history of evaporation process, the high value of Mg 2 + suggests pollution from application of <b>magnesium</b> sulphate <b>fertilizers</b> (anthropogenic pollution factor) to agricultural lands (Rawat and Tripathi 2015; Singh et al. 2015) and high loading on TS and TDS accounts for low mixing of overlying soft soil after percolation due to monsoon runoff pollution. Therefore, two facts are responsible for high loading on these elements, lowering of groundwater table (during pre-monsoon) and anthropogenic pollution due to direct discharge of sewage into water body without treatment (Gautam et al. 2013). During the summer season, without recharge, lowering of groundwater table occurs since high concentration Ca 2 +, Cl−, and TDS were recorded. The other contributing process is suggested as anthropogenic pollution due to presence of Mg 2 + and SO 4 2 − (leach of <b>magnesium</b> sulphate <b>fertilizers,</b> Hounslow 1995; Hem 1989; Singh et al. 2015).|$|R

The treatments consisted {{of potassium}} fertilizer with three levels (0, 60 and 120 kg ha- 1) and <b>magnesium</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (0, 75 and 150 kg ha- 1). The {{results showed that}} the maximum biomass (8890 kg h- 1) was obtained with application of 120 kg K ha- 1 and 75 kg ha- 1 of magnesium. The highest harvest index (32 %) was obtained from with application of 60 kg of potassium fertilizer. The maximum 100 seed weight (5. 7 g) was obtained due to the application of the 60 kg potassium plus 75 kg ha- 1 of magnesium. Application of 120 kg ha- 1 potassium and 150 kg magnesium produced the greatest grain yield (2447. 1 kg ha- 1). The highest seed oil content was obtained by the application of 60 kg ha- 1 potassium. The highest oil yield obtained with application of 120 kg potassium (790 kg ha- 1) and 150 kg magnesium (700 kg ha- 1) though, it was not significantly different with the oil yield at the presence of 60 and 75 kg ha- 1 of potassium and magnesium, respectively.

Please check for recent information at the OSU Extension Service website: [URL] from fertilizer experiments with potatoes in the Willamette Valley from 1961 through 1971 show that responses have been measured from nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and lime. Responses from these nutrients have been related to soil and/or plant analysis values. In recent years most of the potato production has moved from hill soil areas to valley floor soils with much of the production following cereal crops with the straw disced or plowed into the soil before planting potatoes. These experiments show that 150 to 200 pounds of nitrogen per acre should be applied for April-planted potatoes following a cereal crop, and this rate should be reduced to 50 to 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre for late May plantings or where potatoes follow a heavily fertilized row crop.

The coexisting pesticides were found to hinder the performance of wood charcoal in removing endosulfan. Competitive uptake study revealed that endosulfan occupies more sites followed by atrazine and monocrotophos. Solubility in water {{could be one of}} the major reasons for this preferential order. The presence of humic acid was found to show much more significant influence on the performance of wood charcoal than the presence of polyacrylic acid. Among fertilizers, single superphosphate was found more influential. Most of it, among the other reasons, could be due to the competition of the coexisting molecules for the available adsorption sites on wood charcoal. Other parameters have resulted in some fluctuations in performance, but the effects are not significant. Endosulfan removal efficiency faltered at higher pH values, and ionic species did not affect the sorption as endosulfan is nonionic under neutral conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In South Brazil slash {{and burn}} {{plays a major}} role for great number of small farmers. However, there is almost no {{fertilization}} with mineral fertilizers to compensate the nutrient loss. The aim was to assess the ecological risks. An inventory of the nutrients in the biomass and the soil was done and the potential loss by burning was calculated. Nutrient input by precipitation was measured weekly to estimate the compensation of nutrient losses by atmospheric input. The nutrient status of the ecosystem was on a high level. It was far away from the status of natural rainforests on Ferralsols in the humid tropics. Assessing the ecological risk by a worst case scenario a twofold repetition of slash and burn would empty almost the total stock of exchangeable Mg in the soil. However, considering the real situation after practicing slash and burn for more than 100 years {{there is no indication that}} this is real scenario. Obviously the nutrient loss is smaller and a recuperation of the ecosystem occurs by atmospheric input and weathering of primary silicates. For to maintain sustainability it is recommended to provide a recovery time of at least some decades. Nutrient loss could be strongly reduced if branches would be left in the system and biomass extraction was restricted to stemwood. It would be helpful if magnesium loss could be partly compensated through liming or <b>magnesium</b> <b>fertilizers...</b>|$|R

MethodsBoth “ 3414 ” application and orthogonal test designs were performed at Shilin county, Yunnan province, China, for NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and mineral fertilizers, respectively. The data were used to construct the one-, two-, and three-factor quadratic regression models. The effect of fertilizer deficiency on root yield loss was also analyzed to confirm the result predicted by these models. A pot culture experiment was performed to observe the incidence rate of root rot disease and to obtain the best range in which the highest yield of root and saponins could be realized. ResultsThe best application strategy for NPK fertilizer was 0  kg/ 667  m 2, 17. 01  kg/ 667  m 2, and 56. 87  kg/ 667  m 2, respectively, which can produce the highest root yield of 1, 861. 90  g (dried root of 100 plants).

Fertilization with urea in both liquid and dry forms involves the risk of considerable N loss to the atmosphere as gaseous ammonia (NH[subscript] 3). This NH[subscript] 3 volatilization {{is a major}} N loss mechanism of surface-applied urea. Among the methods that have been proposed to reduce this N loss are the application of urea with urease inhibitors and the combinations of urea with cationic materials. Studies on the effects of urease inhibitors and cationic materials on growth response and NH[subscript] 3 volatilization were conducted from 1983 through 1987 in both the field and laboratory. The purpose of the work reported in this dissertation was to evaluate the urease inhibitors phenylphosphorodiamidate (PPD), N -(n -butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), and ammonium thiosulfate (ATS), and the cations potassium (K[superscript]+) and <b>magnesium</b> (Mg[superscript]++) as <b>fertilizer</b> amendments for increasing urea-N efficiency by measuring the effect of these compounds on growth response and NH[subscript] 3 volatilization following application of urea to Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) turf.

It keep into this challenge {{an increase in the}} agricultural production must reach 90 % of the already cultivated land. It is clear that mineral fertilizers will continue {{to play an important role}} in improving agricultural production. A fertilizer is by definition ”any product containing at least 5 % of the three major plant nutrients: N, P 2 O 5, and K 2 O. The most common fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, <b>magnesium</b> and sulphur <b>fertilizers.</b> They can be simple, single or complex nutrients. Currently, phosphate fertilizers are by far the most prevalent. However, the fertilizers produced from phosphate ores still contain heavy metals that are harmful to human health. These heavy metals are transferred through processing to phosphoric acid: the main intermediary between the rock and phosphate fertilizers. Among these heavy metals, cadmium seems to be the most harmful and toxic element. The occurrence of such element in the fertilizer products causes a serious danger to both human health and environment. Most of the phosphate-bearing rocks contain large Cd amounts that are often above acceptable levels. Phosphate ore industry usually tends to improve the quality of product by eliminating this toxic element. The aim of this study is to present an accurate and less expensive method by which cadmium in phosphate ore would be reduced to lower rates. The method uses ammonium acetate salt, diamine tetra-acetic and hydrochloric acids as extracting agents of cadmium in phosphate.

40|$|Water {{comprises}} 99 % of most spray {{solutions and}} {{properties of the}} water used as carrier can influence the efficacy of herbicides. Water pH is one property of water which can limit the solubility of some herbicides or cause degradation of herbicides through hydrolysis. Water hardness, or the amount of dissolved cations in water, can reduce herbicide efficacy due to binding of herbicide molecules to cations. The presence of these cations can cause reduced absorption or translocation of the herbicide into plants. Glyphosate is the most studied herbicide {{with respect to the}} influence of water pH and hardness. Some herbicides have also exhibited reduced efficacy when co-applied with other herbicides or foliar fertilizers. Antagonism of herbicides has been documented with protoporphyrinogen IX inhibiting herbicides and glyphosate. Glyphosate has been documented to exhibit reduced phytotoxicity when applied with manganese fertilizer. The objective of this research was to evaluate the response of selected herbicides applied in water with varying pH and hardness, or co-applied with various herbicides and foliar fertilizers. ^ Saflufenacil, a protoporphyrinogen IX inhibitor, was tested to determine a response to five pH levels (4. 0, 5. 2, 6. 5, 7. 7, and 9. 0) or three water hardness levels (0, 310, and 620 mg L- 1). A field study on common lambsquarters and giant ragweed was conducted as well as a greenhouse bioassay on horseweed and corn to determine the influence of these water properties on saflufenacil efficacy. In both the field and greenhouse experiments, no influence of water hardness was seen when proper adjuvants were included in the spray solution. However, water pH at 4. 0 reduced the efficacy of saflufenacil on common lambsquarters in the field experiments and corn in the greenhouse experiments. High pressure liquid chromatography testing on the solubility of saflufenacil found that the solubility of saflufenacil was reduced from 3, 687 mg L- 1 at pH 7. 7 to 10 mg L- 1 at pH 4. 0. This reduction in solubility may have led to the reduced efficacy on corn in the greenhouse where a pH of 4. 0 showed only 79 % reduction in growth as compared to 87 % reduction in growth with a pH of 7. 7. ^ A second study on saflufenacil was conducted to test if adjusting the pH of the saflufenacil solution would influence efficacy. Saflufenacil was mixed in five different carrier waters with initial pH values of 4. 0, 5. 2, 6. 5, 7. 7, or 9. 0 and adjusted to one of four final pH levels (4. 0, 6. 5, 9. 0, or no change). When initial pH levels were acidic (4. 0 or 5. 2) and raised to a more neutral pH, saflufenacil efficacy on corn was increased. It was also observed that when initial pH was 6. 5 or 7. 7 and reduced to 4. 0, saflufenacil efficacy on corn was reduced. ^ Saflufenacil was also tested for interaction with fourteen herbicides. A field study was conducted on fallow ground containing common lambsquarters, giant ragweed, and giant foxtail. Saflufenacil co-applied with glyphosate or glufosinate provided the most consistent and best control of giant foxtail and common lambsquarters at 14 days after treatment. At 21 days after treatment, control of common lambsquarters was best with 2, 4 -D and dicamba mixed with saflufenacil. All tank mixtures provided 85 % or more control of common lambsquarters except imazaquin, imazethapyr, or chlorimuron-methyl co-applied with saflufenacil. All tank mixtures provided better control of weeds as compared to saflufenacil alone. ^ 2, 4 -D and dicamba, two growth regulator herbicides, were tested for a reduction in efficacy when applied in water with calcium ions, <b>magnesium</b> ions, manganese <b>fertilizer,</b> or zinc fertilizer. 2, 4 -D control of horseweed or redroot pigweed was decreased when ammonium sulfate {{was not included in the}} spray solution regardless of the presence of cations or fertilizers. Overall, 2, 4 -D efficacy was reduced when applied in water containing manganese fertilizer as compared to 2, 4 -D applied in deionized water. The presence of calcium ions decreased 2, 4 -D control of common lambsquarters when ammonium sulfate was not used. Dicamba control of common lambsquarters and redroot pigweed was decreased when applied in water with magnesium or manganese in the absence of ammonium sulfate. No reduction in dicamba control of horseweed was noted across cation solutions, as was seen with 2, 4 -D. ...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the drive}} to develop non-oil based economy the UAE is {{continuing}} a programme of economic diversification, and is keen to develop its non-oil assets, such as its industrial mineral resources. A review of the industrial minerals sector in the UAE {{was carried out in}} 2002 to 2006 by the BGS as {{part of the}} work commissioned by the UAE federal Ministry of Energy. One of the highest priority recommendations from the review was that an evaluation of the potential for the production of industrial limestone and dolomite from resources within the UAE be carried out. It was considered that this would yield the benefit as there is potential to develop a sustainable industry that could remove the need for high-value mineral filler imports and create a lucrative export market. Currently the limestone and dolomite resources of the UAE are mainly exploited for construction aggregate. They have an intrinsically low value. There is little production of higher value limestone and dolomite products in the UAE and such commodities are imported. In 2008 the British Geological Survey (BGS) was commissioned by the UAE Ministry of Energy to carry out a resource assessment to identify high-purity limestone and dolomite resources {{that could be used for}} higher value applications. An initial market survey was carried out in Dubai to determine the requirements of industry in the UAE for limestone and dolomite. In addition a review was made of the commercial applications of limestone (which industry refers to as ‘calcium carbonate’) and dolomite and the physical properties required for individual applications, and the market for the commodities. High purity limestone is used as a raw material for the production of paint, paper, plastic, rubber, adhesives, caulks and sealants, agricultural, sports and environmental applications, ceramics, food and pharmaceuticals, animal feed and glass. High-purity dolomite is used for agricultural lime and the production of magnesia (MgO) for the manufacture of refractories, glass, <b>magnesium</b> chemicals, pharmaceuticals, <b>fertilizers</b> and <b>magnesium</b> metal. The assessment project started with a desk study and evaluation of limestone and dolomite samples collected by previous work in the UAE, to identify the resources with the best potential. A reconnaissance survey collected 221 samples from the limestone resources identified by the desk study. These were analysed in BGS laboratories to determine their chemical, mineralogical and physical properties. The limestones identified as having potentially the best quality were revisited in a second phase of field work when ten bulk samples were collected. These were analysed for their suitability as mineral filler, lime and construction aggregate. The analyses are summarised on a limestone and dolomite resource map of the northern emirates which illustrated the distribution of all limestones, colour-coded in terms of their purity. The main commercial quality criterion used to assess the purity of limestone is the calcium carbonate content and for dolomite it is the dolomite content. The magnesia, silica and iron oxide contents, and the brightness were also considered. The mineral filler properties, construction aggregate properties and lime burning properties were assessed for ten limestone occurrences. Approximately a third of the limestone in the northern emirates of the UAE has been found to be ‘high-purity’. This means it can be used to produce high-value limestone products that could be used by industry in the UAE as a substitute for the limestone they are currently importing. The resources identified to be high-purity include the Ruus al Jibal Group (undivided) and the Rus, Musandam 3, Musandam 2 and Dammam Limestone formations. In addition, ‘high-purity’ dolomite was also identified with the potential for industrial use. This study has shown that the UAE has resources of high purity limestone and dolomite, the development of which has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the economic diversification of the UAE economy. As a consequence of the assessment, the following recommendations are made: • Undertake investment promotion activities to alert interested parties to the limestone and dolomite resources available in the UAE. This could include the production of a freely available investment brochure and attendance at trade exhibitions. • Make more detailed assessment of the five top priority limestone resources to include more sampling and a drilling programme to increase the confidence of the resource assessment. • Undertake further assessment of the high-purity dolomite resources including additional sampling and a drilling programme. • Consider investigating further with companies in the UAE the end-use suitability of the limestone and dolomite resources of the UAE for the manufacture of paper, paint, rubber, plastic, ceramics and glass. • Make an assessment of the potential industrial suitability of the fine waste produced by limestone quarries in the UAE. • Establish an ‘Industrial Minerals Industry Forum’ to promote a better understanding of the needs of industry, provide information to the government and support the development of an indigenous minerals industry in the UAE...|$|R
40|$|The use of biofertilizers in {{protected}} environments {{have been}} used to reduce the use of pesticides and protecting plants from pests and diseases, especially when weather conditions are adverse during the rainy season in the Northeast. Looking analyze these aspects, two surveys were conducted aiming to verify the behavior of the hybrid yellow peppers, irrigated and organic management under different environments and dosages of biofertilizers. In the first study treatments consisted of using three environments (greenhouse and open field trellis) and five doses of biofertilizer (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mL plant- 1 week- 1) applied through drip irrigation. It were observed temperature, relative humidity and incident solar radiation, and determined the following parameters of plant growth: Plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, average length and diameter, flesh thickness, total soluble solids and yield per plant. In the second study, measurements of other biofertilizer (0, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mL plant- 1 week- 1), due to the financial analysis of the first study demonstrated RBC < 1. 0 and negative NPV for all treatments were used in addition to low productivity. In addition to the determinations of the growth parameters and post-harvest of the first study, were determined in leaves the macronutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S). The climatic data were compared using linear regression and correlation coefficients. Growth variables, production and post-harvest were subjected to analysis of variance. When significant by F-test, the data regarding the types of environments (qualitative treatment) underwent test of means by Tukey test. Data regarding dosages of biofertilizer (subplot, quantitative) were subjected to regression analysis seeking to adjust equations with biological meanings. In the financial analysis were determined cash flow and profitability following indicators: cost benefit ratio, net present value, and internal rate of return and sensitivity analysis. According to the results, it was concluded: the dosages of biofertilizers adopted by producers of Sierra Ibiapaba are incipient to a first crop of peppers under organic management, the environment greenhouse is the most suitable for the cultivation of sweet pepper even with temperatures more high that the trellis and open fields, the organic cultivation of sweet pepper under biofertilizer doses of between 20 and 80 mL plant- 1 week- 1 is financially unfeasible. The cultivation of sweet pepper in greenhouses with the higher dosage of biofertilizers proved to be the most efficient in most growth variables, production and post-harvest analyzed. The levels of nitrogen, potassium, magnesium and calcium were higher in the leaves of the greenhouse and trellis. On the other hand, the phosphorus content was higher in plants open, while the sulfur showed similar values for the three environments, in spite of a small decrease in the trellis plant environment. As for dosages of biofertilizer, it is found increasing linear trend with increasing dosages for contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and decreases in the level of calcium and <b>magnesium,</b> with increasing <b>fertilizer.</b> This decrease was also observed in the sulfur content, but a more sharply from 200 mL plant- 1 week- 1. Organic cultivation of sweet pepper under proper Biofertilization is financially viable, especially in the greenhouse environment. O uso de biofertilizantes em ambientes protegidos tem sido utilizado para reduzir o emprego de agrotÃxicos e proteger as plantas das pragas e doenÃas, principalmente quando as condiÃÃes climÃticas sÃo adversas durante a estaÃÃo chuvosa do Nordeste. Procurando analisar estes aspectos, foram realizadas duas pesquisas objetivando verificar o comportamento do pimentÃo hÃbrido amarelo, irrigado e com manejo orgÃnico, sob diferentes ambientes e dosagens de biofertilizantes. No primeiro estudo os tratamentos consistiram da utilizaÃÃo de trÃs ambientes (estufa, latada e campo aberto) e de cinco dosagens de biofertilizante (0, 20, 40, 60 e 80 mL planta- 1 semana- 1) aplicadas via irrigaÃÃo por gotejamento. Foram observadas temperatura, umidade relativa e incidÃncia de radiaÃÃo solar e determinados os seguintes parÃmetros de crescimento: altura de plantas, diÃmetro do caule, Ãrea foliar, comprimento mÃdio e diÃmetro dos frutos, espessura da polpa, teor de sÃlidos solÃveis e produÃÃo por planta. No segundo estudo, foram utilizadas outras dosagens do biofertilizante (0, 250, 500, 750 e 1000 mL planta- 1 semana- 1), devido a anÃlise financeira do primeiro estudo ter demonstrado RBC < 1, 0 e VPL negativo para todos os tratamentos, alÃm de baixas produtividades. Adicionalmente Ãs determinaÃÃes dos parÃmetros de crescimento e de pÃs-colheita do primeiro estudo, foram determinados nas folhas os teores de macronutrientes (N, P, K, Ca, Mg e S). Os dados microclimÃticos coletados foram comparados por meio de regressÃes lineares e coeficientes de determinaÃÃo. As variÃveis de crescimento, de produÃÃo e de pÃs-colheita foram submetidas Ã anÃlise de variÃncia. Quando significativos pelo teste F, os dados referentes aos tipos de ambientes (tratamentos qualitativos) foram submetidos a teste de mÃdias pelo teste de Tukey. Os dados referentes Ãs dosagens do biofertilizante (subtratamentos, quantitativos) foram submetidos Ã anÃlise de regressÃo buscando-se ajustar equaÃÃes com significados biolÃgicos. Na anÃlise financeira foram determinados o fluxo de caixa e os seguintes indicadores de rentabilidade: relaÃÃo benefÃcio custo, valor presente lÃquido, taxa interna de retorno e anÃlise de sensibilidade. Conforme os resultados obtidos, concluiu-se: as dosagens de biofertilizante adotadas pelos produtores da Serra da Ibiapaba sÃo incipientes para um primeiro cultivo de pimentÃo, sob manejo orgÃnico; o ambiente estufa Ã o mais adequado para o cultivo do pimentÃo amarelo mesmo apresentando temperaturas mais elevadas que a latada e o campo aberto; o cultivo orgÃnico do pimentÃo amarelo sob dosagens de biofertilizante entre 20 e 80 mL planta- 1 semana- 1 Ã inviÃvel financeiramente. O cultivo do pimentÃo amarelo em estufa com a mais elevada dosagem de biofertilizante mostrou-se o mais eficiente na maioria das variÃveis de crescimento, de produÃÃo e de pÃs-colheita analisadas. Os teores de nitrogÃnio, de potÃssio, de magnÃsio e de cÃlcio foram maiores nas folhas das plantas da estufa e latada. Por outro lado, o teor de fÃsforo foi superior nas plantas de campo aberto, enquanto o enxofre apresentou valores similares nos trÃs ambientes, no que pese um pequeno decrÃscimo nas plantas do ambiente latada. Quanto Ãs dosagens dos biofertilizantes, constataram-se tendÃncias lineares crescentes com o aumento das dosagens para os teores de nitrogÃnio, do fÃsforo, do potÃssio e decrÃscimos no nÃvel do cÃlcio e do magnÃsio, com o aumento do fertilizante. Este decrÃscimo foi tambÃm observado no teor do enxofre, contudo de uma maneira mais acentuada, a partir de 200 mL planta- 1. O cultivo orgÃnico do pimentÃo amarelo sob adequada biofertilizaÃÃo Ã viÃvel financeiramente, principalmente no ambiente estuf...|$|R
