The ferritin level falls with increasing hepcidin production after transplantation. Neither inflammatory indices (IL 6) nor erythropoietin appear {{to be related to}} hepcidin expression in this case.

40|$|Habitat {{disturbance}} and {{the spread}} of invasive organisms are major threats to biodiversity, but the interactions between these two factors remain poorly understood in many systems. Grazing activities may facilitate the spread of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) through tropical Australia by providing year-round access to otherwise-seasonal resources. We quantified the cane toad’s use of cowpats (feces piles) in the field, and conducted experimental trials to assess the potential role of cowpats as sources of prey, water, and warmth for toads. Our field surveys show that cane toads are found on or near cowpats more often than expected by chance. Field-enclosure experiments show that cowpats facilitate toad feeding by providing access to dung beetles. Cowpats also offer moist surfaces that can reduce dehydration rates of toads and are warmer than other nearby substrates. Livestock grazing is the primary form of land use over vast areas of Australia, and pastoral activities <b>may</b> have <b>contributed</b> <b>substantially</b> <b>to</b> the cane toad’s successful invasion of that continent...|$|R
40|$|Coral reef {{functioning}} {{is based}} on fixation and cycling of essential C and N. Here, research into these processes is presented from a northern Red Sea coral reef. Water column photosynthetic primary production was relatively low compared to other seas and lowest in the oligotrophic summer. Water column N 2 fixation was stable throughout the year and <b>may</b> have <b>contributed</b> <b>substantially</b> <b>to</b> the N demand of planktonic primary producers during oligotrophic summer. Benthic primary production was dominated by hard and soft corals, while highest benthic N 2 fixation was performed by microbial mats, the coral rock reef structure, the carbonate sediment community, and turf algae. The reef {{community as a whole}} acted net autotrophic in winter and spring, balanced in summer, and net heterotrophic in fall. Uptake of dissolved organic C via sponges was comparable to reef primary production.

40|$|Dispersal {{limitation}} may promote high tree-species {{diversity in}} rain forest by slowing local competitive exclusion, but evidence is scarce.

Local seedling species richness was not limited by the local richness of adults. Using these data, a spatially explicit simulation model indicated that dispersal limitation <b>may</b> not <b>contribute</b> <b>substantially</b> <b>to</b> the maintenance of tree diversity in this forest.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of isoprene (2 -methyl- 1, 3 -butadiene) {{is known}} to {{play a central role}} in the photochemistry of the troposphere, but is generally not considered to lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), due to the relatively high volatility of known reaction products. However, in the chamber studies described here, we measure SOA production from isoprene photooxidation under high-NO_x conditions, at significantly lower isoprene concentrations than had been observed previously. Mass yields are low (0. 9 – 3. 0 %), but because of large emissions, isoprene photooxidation <b>may</b> still <b>contribute</b> <b>substantially</b> <b>to</b> global SOA production. Results from photooxidation experiments of compounds structurally similar to isoprene (1, 3 -butadiene and 2 - and 3 -methyl- 1 -butene) suggest that SOA formation from isoprene oxidation proceeds from the further reaction of first-generation oxidation products (i. e., the oxidative attack of both double bonds).
