40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the incidence and {{risk factors for}} laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) retreatment and to present a novel retreatment technique. Design: Retrospective noncomparative consecutive case series. Participants: Two thousand four hundred eighty-five eyes (1306 patients) underwent LASIK surgery for myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism using either the Summit Apex Plus or the Alcon LADARVision excimer laser systems. Only retreatments for residual refractive error were included. Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence and incidence of retreatments were determined. Potential risk fac-tors for retreatment, including age, gender, and attempted correction, were assessed. Refractive error and a ratio of residual sphere to cylinder in retreated eyes were also analyzed. Results: Of the total cohort studied, 288 eyes of 233 patients underwent one retreatment, and 3 eyes of 3 patients required two retreatment procedures. The overall 1 -year incidence of retreatment was 10. 5 %. The average length of time between initial treatment and enhancement was 7. 3 6. 4 months; 85 % of retreatments took place within 1 year. Two hundred eighty-five of the 288 retreatments were accomplished using a <b>manual</b> <b>flap</b> lift approach; 3 eyes required a repeat microkeratome cut. Higher initial corrections and residual astigmatism were associated with a significantly higher rate of retreatment. Patients older than 40 years were at greater ris...|$|E
2500|$|The 1966 model saw great {{changes to}} the 150 design. The tailfin was swept back 35 degrees to match the styling of the Cessna 172 and other models. The cabin doors were made 23% wider, new brakes were brought in and the 6.00×6 tires were made standard. The {{previously}} <b>manual</b> <b>flaps</b> were now electrically actuated through a panel-mounted flap switch. The old electric stall warning system was replaced with a pneumatic-type. The baggage compartment was enlarged by 50%. A total of 3087 of the newly styled [...] "F" [...] models were produced.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} of the M106 was built and flown in the Slovak Republic around 2003. Its constant chord wing has twin tubular aluminium spars with wooden ribs and, {{like the rest of}} the aircraft, is fabric covered. The wing, with 2° of dihedral, carries pushrod-operated Frise ailerons and <b>manual</b> <b>flaps.</b> On each side a pair of V-form lift struts of circular cross section brace the wing to the lower fuselage longerons, assisted by further jury struts. The fuselage and empennage have a steel alloy structure. The fin and rudder are swept and the horizontal tail placed slightly above the upper fuselage line; the fin and tailplane are wire braced together. The port elevator carries a trim tab. There is side-by-side seating for two under the wing leading edge.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} high density PVC foam and epoxy resin composites. Standard engines available are the [...] Rotax 912S, [...] Jabiru 2200, [...] Jabiru 3300 and the [...] ULPower UL260i four-stroke powerplants. The landing gear {{is made from}} 7175-T6 aluminum alloy and employs a freely-castering nosewheel and main wheels brakes for steering. The wing features electrically-actuated <b>flaps.</b> <b>Manual</b> trim is standard with electric trim optional.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{determine}} the inter-examiner {{agreement of the}} manual values of central and peripheral corneal thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT Visante) and to assess the agreement between AS-OCT Visante pachymetry, Orbscan II and ultrasound pachymetry (USP). MethodsCentral and peripheral (4. 0 mm from the corneal centre to the superior, inferior, nasal and temporal areas) corneal thickness was analyzed in 30 eyes of 15 patients (mean age, 26. 8 ± 6. 8 years), with the AS-OCT Visante both automatically (Global-Pachymetry Map) and manually (Flap Tool). The Orbscan II and USP (Corneo-Gage Plus) pachymetry were also assessed. Inter-examiner reproducibility for the manual values of the AS-OCT Visante was calculated. Automatic and manual AS-OCT pachymetries were compared for all corneal locations. ResultsGood inter-examiner agreement was obtained for the manual values of the AS-OCT Visante for all locations studied (p= 1. 00). The automatic value was {{significantly different from the}} manual value for both central and inferior pachymetry (37 ± 10 μm and 27 ± 11 μm respectively; p< 0. 05). Good linear correlation was found between the automatic AS-OCT Visante, the Orbscan II and USP, although there were statistically significant differences (p< 0. 01) between all of the corneal locations, {{with the exception of the}} manual values of the AS-OCT Visante and the Orbscan II for the central corneal thickness (CCT) measures. ConclusionsThe AS-OCT Visante has high inter-examiner agreement for <b>manual</b> values (<b>Flap</b> Tool). The automatic analysis (Global-Pachymetry Map) provides different corneal thickness values (centrally and peripherally) than those obtained manually for the same corneal scan...|$|R
