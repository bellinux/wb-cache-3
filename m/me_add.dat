500|$|On July 11, 2008, Shinoda's second {{public art}} show [...] "Glorious Excess (BORN)" [...] premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. The show {{included}} nine new pieces, with an exclusive signing on opening night. The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to <b>me.</b> <b>Add</b> to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E
500|$|The cast of FOX musical series Glee {{performed}} {{this song}} on the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol", with Heather Morris' character, Brittany Pierce, taking the lead. The episode revolved around teen drinking and its dangers. The members of Glee Club are asked to perform at the school's alcohol awareness assembly, in which [...] "Tik Tok" [...] {{is one of the}} songs performed. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that the song's inclusion in the episode was superfluous, stating that it was just an excuse to get a Kesha song on Glee. VanDerWerff however, wrote that he [...] "REALLY liked Heather Morris'" [...] rendition of the song. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised Brittany's choreography and overall performance in [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "The huge star of this number was clearly Brittany, who more and more every week proves that she needs to be moved to the forefront of this show's big performances and storylines." [...] Gonzalez gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a B, calling it [...] "pure, fun entertainment up until we got to the part straight out of the mind of Gordie LaChance. So even though the purple vomit was a bit too much for this weak viewer, the performance made <b>me</b> <b>add</b> a Ke$ha song to my iTunes, which I never thought would happen." [...] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a mostly positive review, writing, [...] "Love Brittany as we do, we wish Rachel or Mercedes stepped up to the mic. The performance is less risqué than their Pep Rally [...] "Push It" [...] but winds up causing more controversy when Brittany pukes on Rachel and Santana also vomits up grey slush. It's a fitting end to the song, and the episode." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never saw}} Robert so enraged about a criticism. He is better now, let <b>me</b> <b>add.</b>|$|E

60|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>add</b> here, regretfully {{but with}} {{infinite}} respect, {{one other thing}} about Parker, and then she shall drop into her proper place.|$|E
6000|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>add</b> a {{few words}} more and then bring to a close this story of two young soldiers' adventures while [...] "Marching on Niagara." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{have you}} done?' said Lucilla, whose blood was up. 'You {{have taken a}} liberty, {{which is the best}} proof of what your {{feelings}} are, and every moment that you force your presence on <b>me</b> <b>adds</b> to the offence!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have met}} them," [...] I {{answered}} sharply, for his words about Blanche angered <b>me,</b> <b>adding,</b> [...] "I have noted, Kari, {{that you have}} never a good word for any one whom I favour. You are jealous-natured, Kari, especially of women." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon this {{rallying}} him, {{he told me}} I {{had either}} perfectly studied the art of humour, or else what was the greatest difficulty to others was natural to <b>me,</b> <b>adding</b> that {{nothing could be more}} obliging to a man of honour than not to be soliciting and craving.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a mouthful. And, let <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> I {{consider}} {{these young men}} gentlemen, and I won't have them annoyed while they are in my place." ...|$|E
60|$|Before I leave let <b>me</b> <b>add</b> {{my thanks}} to those of Mr. Clayton for the {{kindness}} you have shown in permitting us the use of your cabin.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{more than}} I expect many things," [...] he {{replied with a}} shrewd glance at <b>me,</b> <b>adding,</b> [...] "I always rise with the sun, and {{thinking}} that I heard a shot fired in the distance, came {{to see what was}} happening. The Basutos attacked you at daybreak, did they not?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Simon Abrams of Politico {{compared}} Nukie {{to another}} 1988 E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial knock-off, Mac and Me. Abrams wrote that Nukie {{was worse than}} Mac and <b>Me,</b> <b>adding</b> that it was [...] "probably the most incompetent E.T. ripoff of any time period ... While Mac and Me was just rotten and ill-conceived, Nukie is uniquely perplexing." ...|$|R
60|$|So I {{turned and}} beckoned to my captains, and Kari beckoned to his. They came, {{and in the}} hearing of all, very clearly and quietly as was his fashion, he {{repeated}} every word that he had said to <b>me,</b> <b>adding</b> to them others of like meaning. While he spoke I thought, not listening over-much.|$|R

60|$|The Elephant was my wife's; {{so she is}} proportionately elate {{you should}} have picked it out for praise--from a collection, let <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> so replete with the highest qualities of art.|$|E
6000|$|... "The thought {{comes to}} me to begin to satisfy my heart with thy coward blood and that of thy companions," [...] said Ayesha contemptuously. Then she paused and turning to <b>me,</b> <b>added,</b> [...] "O Watcher-by-Night, what counsel? Is there aught that will {{convince}} these chicken-hearted ones over whom I have spread my feathers for so long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oho!" [...] he laughed, [...] "it is very easy," [...] and {{snatching}} up {{a little}} assegai that lay beside him, he proffered it to <b>me,</b> <b>adding,</b> [...] "Be brave now and fall on that. Then before I have counted sixty the road will be wide open, but whether you will see anything on it I cannot tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know all}} that,' said the King, kindly. 'There is time enough for {{settling}} that question; and meantime {{you will not}} be spoilt for monk or priest by cheering me awhile in my captivity. I need you, laddie,' <b>me</b> <b>added,</b> laying his hand on the boy's shoulder, with all the instinctive fascination of a Stewart. 'I lack a comrade of my own blood, for I am all alone!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Morris," [...] {{interrupted}} Michael, [...] "I do {{wish you}} would let <b>me</b> <b>add</b> one point, for I think it will affect your judgment. It's pathetic too--since that's your taste in literature." ...|$|E
60|$|May. 'Tis rightly judged: And, let <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> {{who heads}} a popular cause, Must prosecute that cause by popular ways: So, whether you are merciful or no, You must affect to be.|$|E
6000|$|Mar. Yet {{this strange}} disproportion in your years, [...] And, let <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> {{disparity}} of tempers, [...] Might {{make the world}} doubt whether such an union [...] Could make you wisely, permanently happy.|$|E
60|$|LADY TEAZLE. Well {{then and}} there is but one thing more you can make <b>me</b> to <b>add</b> to the obligation.|$|R
5000|$|... 'So am I American', she said, {{speaking}} educated, cultivated French; and, having surprised <b>me,</b> coolly <b>added</b> 'Central American, from Martinique' [...] ".|$|R
60|$|EDSTASTON. As you did {{not give}} it, I don't know. Allow <b>me</b> to <b>add</b> that I have not asked for your advice.|$|R
6000|$|... "With all the {{pleasure}} in the world," [...] he answered heartily. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>add</b> too that I am thankful for your decision. You have somewhere to go to in London, I hope." ...|$|E
60|$|The Elephant was my wife's; {{so she is}} proportionately elate {{you should}} have picked it out for praise - from a collection, let <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> so replete with the highest qualities of art.|$|E
60|$|Having {{come to this}} {{resolution}} (and deriving, let <b>me</b> <b>add,</b> parenthetically, great consolation from it), the next subject of consideration was the best method of getting safely into the top regions of the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{of course}} not. There {{was really no}} need for me to ask you. Then you promise you will do all I wish?" [...] and once more she looked at <b>me,</b> <b>adding,</b> [...] "Don't be ashamed, for you {{remember}} that I have {{been in touch with}} hidden things and am not quite as other women are.

6000|$|... "I said 'no,' but {{told him}} I {{was very well}} acquainted with his handwriting. Then {{he said he would}} write out a card for <b>me,</b> <b>adding,</b> with a laugh, that he wanted me to be sure he was really Dave. He drew a blank card {{out of his pocket and}} turned to a table to write on it and then handed it to me. Here is the card now;" [...] and, going to the mantelpiece, the lady of the house {{produced}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the cure}} of bodies, ye'll be {{permitting}} <b>me</b> to <b>add,</b> Sir Gervaise," [...] observed Magrath, taking an enormous pinch {{of a strong}} yellow snuff.|$|R
