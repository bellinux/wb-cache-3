5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier. In the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip, but maintained military control of numerous {{aspects of the}} territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing <b>military</b> <b>occupation</b> of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem {{continues to be the}} world's longest <b>military</b> <b>occupation</b> in modern times.|$|E

5|$|The Roman {{presence}} in Scotland was however {{little more than}} a series of relatively brief interludes of partial <b>military</b> <b>occupation.</b> As Roman influence waned in Scotland from 211 onwards, Orkney faded from history again and the Celtic Iron Age way of life continued, largely unchanged.|$|E
5|$|After this incident, Magoon {{remained}} with the Department of War. In 1902, {{his work on}} the legal foundations of the new civil governments was released to the public as a book, Reports on The Law of Civil Government in Territory Subject to <b>Military</b> <b>Occupation</b> by the Military Forces of the United States, etc. It was reprinted several times and was considered the seminal text on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{organs of}} <b>military</b> <b>occupation,</b> and the orders issued by OKH, {{regulating}} {{as they did}} {{a wide range of}} administrative, political, economic, cultural and social matters, the Germans still needed to establish a public administrative body that would implement their directives.

40|$|The {{study is}} ar {{investigation}} and {{demonstration of the}} degree to which military experience in certain specialties is continuous with the career development patterns of workers in the entire United States society. Selected characteristics of 24 <b>military</b> <b>occupations</b> (six from each branch of the services) were compared with similar characteristics of civilian sector occupations or portions of those occupations in the areas of: formal education, vocational/technical training, previous experience, licensing or certification, and union apprenticeship/journeymanship.

5|$|The Great Fire of New York was {{a devastating}} fire that burned {{through the night}} of September 20, 1776, and into the morning of September 21, on the West Side of what then {{constituted}} New York City {{at the southern end}} of the island of Manhattan.

5|$|After Germany surrendered, the Allies {{partitioned}} Berlin and Germany's remaining territory {{into four}} <b>military</b> <b>occupation</b> zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 {{to form the}} Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasize its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo.|$|E

During World War II, {{the camp was}} subject to a short <b>military</b> <b>occupation</b> when it served as a Naval training base, reverting to being a holiday camp in 1946. Over the past 75 years the camp has seen continuous use and development, in the mid-1980s {{and again in the}} late 1990s being subject to substantial investment and redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|A {{stretch of}} land {{containing}} the later strategic strongholds of Amida (Diyarbakır, Turkey) and Bezabde came under firm Roman <b>military</b> <b>occupation.</b> With these territories, Rome {{would have an}} advance station north of Ctesiphon, and {{would be able to}} slow any future advance of Persian forces through the region. Many cities east of the Tigris came under Roman control, including Tigranokert, Saird, Martyropolis, Balalesa, Moxos, Daudia, and Arzan– though under what status is unclear. At the conclusion of the peace, Tiridates regained both his throne and the entirety of his ancestral claim. Rome secured a wide zone of cultural influence, which led to a wide diffusion of Syriac Christianity from a center at Nisibis in later decades, and the eventual Christianization of Armenia.|$|E

5|$|From 1669, Klis Fortress {{was in the}} {{possession}} of the Venetians, and it remained so until the fall of the Venetian state. The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress during their rule. After another, the seventh war with the Turks from 1714 to 1718, the Venetians were able to advance up to the present Bosnian/Croatian border, taking in the whole Sinjsko field and Imotski. Thereafter the Turkish menace was laid to rest and Venice had no serious challenge to its authority in Dalmatia, until Napoleon extinguished the republic itself in 1797. The border between Christian and Muslim Europe had been moved further east, and the fortress lost its main strategic importance. Subsequently, Klis was taken by the Austrians. The last <b>military</b> <b>occupation</b> of Klis Fortress was by Axis powers during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Learning that British {{troops were}} on the way, the Boston Town Meeting met on September 12, 1768 and {{requested}} that Governor Bernard convene the General Court. Bernard refused, so the town meeting called on the other Massachusetts towns to send representatives to meet at Faneuil Hall beginning on September 22. About 100 towns sent delegates to the convention, which was effectively an unofficial session of the Massachusetts House. The convention issued a letter which insisted that Boston was not a lawless town, using language more moderate than what Adams desired, and that the impending <b>military</b> <b>occupation</b> violated Bostonians' natural, constitutional, and charter rights. By {{the time that the}} convention adjourned, British troop transports had arrived in Boston Harbor. Two regiments disembarked in October 1768, followed by two more in November.|$|E
5|$|The 1660 Restoration {{was popular}} in Scotland since it ended the Union and an {{expensive}} <b>military</b> <b>occupation,</b> although ironically it was welcomed in England {{for the same}} reasons. Scottish Parliamentary elections installed a Royalist majority which passed a series of acts giving greater power to the Crown, the most significant being the Rescissory Act of March 1661. This returned Scotland to the constitutional position of 1633, restoring the legal system and Parliament but imposing the Episcopalian structure on the Kirk rejected in 1638. Many were prepared to accept this since continuing divisions within the Presbyterian Kirk made it seem impossible they could create a unified church.|$|E

5|$|The {{eastern part}} of the hill fort {{remained}} in use for at least the first few decades of the Roman occupation, although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain. Many 1st-century Roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort. It has been suggested that Maiden Castle was occupied as a Roman military outpost or fort and the settlement discontinued, as there is no known fort in the area and it was not uncommon for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by Roman forces. This was a characteristic of Vespasian's campaign in the region; there was <b>military</b> <b>occupation</b> at Cadbury Castle in Somerset, Hembury in Devon, and Hodd Hill in Dorset.|$|E
5|$|While many {{soldiers}} were still arriving, {{the citizens of}} Benton held a meeting on August 14 {{to decide whether or}} not they would resist the soldiers. Many argued against it, but approximately 75 men declared they were prepared to resist any <b>military</b> <b>occupation</b> of their part of Columbia County. These men were led by Jacob Schultz, Samuel Kline, and one person from Orangeville. Kline went south to the town to learn more about the soldiers in Bloomsburg. According to an account by Edward McHenry, the other members of the resistance were told to remain at home until news arrived from Bloomsburg. When the draft evaders discovered that the army coming from Bloomsburg was too strong to defeat, McHenry and 20 other draft evaders in the county escaped to North Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Adams wrote {{numerous}} {{letters and}} essays {{in opposition to}} the occupation, which he considered a violation of the 1689 Bill of Rights. The occupation was publicized throughout the colonies in the Journal of Occurrences, an unsigned series of newspaper articles that may have been written by Adams in collaboration with others. The Journal presented what it claimed to be a factual daily account of events in Boston during the <b>military</b> <b>occupation,</b> an innovative approach in an era without professional newspaper reporters. It depicted a Boston besieged by unruly British soldiers who assaulted men and raped women with regularity and impunity, drawing upon the traditional Anglo-American distrust of standing armies garrisoned among civilians. The Journal ceased publication on August 1, 1769, which was a day of celebration in Boston: Governor Bernard had left Massachusetts, never to return.|$|E

50|$|The {{territory}} of Fiume {{after the end}} of the First World War was involved in a series of events that, after various <b>military</b> <b>occupations</b> (the longest lasting was the one led by Gabriele d'Annunzio, also called the Italian Regency of Carnaro), saw the creation of an ephemeral successor entity in the Free State of Fiume.|$|R
