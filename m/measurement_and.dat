5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E

Cortana can forecast results in various other sports such as the NBA, the NFL, the Super Bowl, the ICC Cricket World Cup and various European football leagues.

5|$|When debates {{polarise}} between techniques, {{the methods}} are {{often referred to}} by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished. Green (Old World) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice. Brown (New World) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and {{have been described as}} 'cavalier' on matters of <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> statistical analysis. Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} was to develop teacher performance in educational <b>measurements</b> <b>and</b> evaluations through self-monitoring strategies. Participants comprised 10 administrators and teachers. Qualitative data was collected from informal interviews and a focus group. The {{research was}} conducted in five steps for improving self-monitoring. The results of this research found that the self-monitoring strategies showed that teachers learnt best from the concrete example in the report on test preparation for the Basic Education National test. Teachers intended to learn about learning educational <b>measurements</b> <b>and</b> evaluations through participation in activities. By applying the self-monitoring process, teachers gained further knowledge in learning <b>measurements</b> <b>and</b> evaluations, participating in action planning, as well as greater realization and awareness {{of the importance of}} learning <b>measurements</b> <b>and</b> evaluations...|$|R
