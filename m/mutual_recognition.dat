5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the <b>mutual</b> <b>recognition</b> of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E

However the two jurisdictions continued in amity (<b>mutual</b> <b>recognition)</b> until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them. In 1868 the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana appeared in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction. The new Scottish rite body admitted blacks, and the resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the Grand Lodge to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe peptide and retinal {{mixture of}} bacteriorhodopsin, {{composed}} of two synthetic peptides corresponding to helices F (160 – 197) and G (202 – 237) and a proteinase V 8 -derived fragment V 1 (1 – 166), generated the characteristic features of bacteriorhodopsin with absorbance maximum at 550 nm and fluorescence quenching as in two synthetic peptides corresponded to helix A (sequence 7 – 31) and B (41 – 65), and a chymotryptic fragment (72 – 248). The recovery of reconstitution estimated from the absorption and the fluorescence quenching of these mixture was 16 – 19 % and 25 – 32 % of the native purple membrane, respectively, whereas mixtures lacking {{any one of the}} peptides exhibited no absorption recovery. Circular dichroism of each peptide fragment showed complete formation of α-helical structure in a membrane-mimetic medium of sodium dodecyl sulfate.

He concludes that the dialogue between Belgrade and Priština has been the major political success of the European Union within the frameworks of mechanism of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

60|$|The {{proceedings}} {{began on}} the first morning with the entrance of Mr. Saltzburg, the musical director, a brisk, busy little man with benevolent eyes behind big spectacles, who bustled over to the piano, sat down, and played a loud chord, designed {{to act as a}} sort of bugle blast, rallying the ladies of the ensemble from the corners where they sat in groups, chatting.

Elsewhere other groups had formed, and the room was filled with a noise like the chattering of starlings.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between Norwegian citizens and refugees is ambiguous, were {{some argue that}} refugees should adopt the mainstream culture in Norway. Other advocate the refugees’ right to hold their cultures and beliefs, and {{stress the importance of}} a tolerant state of affairs. This leads to the debate about integration and how to best facilitate the inclusion of newly arrived refugees. Certain groups within the Norwegian community perceive foreign cultures as a threat to society, bolstering the exclusion of minorities. As a consequence, the integration process becomes strained for refugees, despite elaborate strategies designed by the government. For this reason, the Red Cross refugee-guide program attempts to build a positive relation between Norwegians and refugees, on the local level. If integration is viewed from this level, how can interactions between refugees and Norwegians contribute to positive intergroup relations? In turn, can these type of activities lead to the creation a common social framework? This thesis will focus on how intergroup relations {{in the context of the}} refugee-guide, can affect the ambiguous {{relationship between}} Norwegians and refugees in society. By using George H. Mead’s interactionism, one can describe the intersubjective relations of locals and refugees in the refugee-guide. However, because of the descriptive features of interactionism, Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition can fill the missing normative framework. Grounded on Hegel’s three stages of recognition and Mead’s interactionism, Honneth suggests that intersubjective relations based on <b>mutual</b> <b>recognitions,</b> can direct the relations between refugees and locals to a positive and inclusive relationship. If this can be identified in the refugee-guide, then maybe it can be reflected to the relations between Norwegians and refugees in society...|$|R
