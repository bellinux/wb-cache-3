25|$|Nevertheless, Wagner and Minna parted, Wagner {{to travel}} to Venice and Minna to take the waters at Brestenberg {{in an attempt to}} improve her {{worsening}} heart condition. Minna wrote to Mathilde before departing for Dresden: I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> with a bleeding heart that you have succeeded in separating my husband from me after nearly twenty-two years of marriage. May this noble deed contribute to your peace of mind, to your happiness.|$|E
25|$|I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that in Mauritania, {{freedom is}} total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – {{of all men}} and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

"Dear Lucy, Your letter gave {{me quite}} a shock, fancy you wanting to draw four pounds {{to buy a}} brooch, ring, bangle, work basket, tea set, etc, etc. [...] I am quite sure Mrs. Henry would expend the money {{carefully}} for you, but I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that no Aborigine can draw 4/5 of their wages unless they are sick and in hospital and require {{the money to buy}} comforts... However, as it is Christmas I will let you have 1/5/ – out of your banking account to buy lollies with." ...|$|E

500|$|He walked under guard from St James's Palace, {{where he}} had been confined, to the Palace of Whitehall, where an {{execution}} scaffold was erected in front of the Banqueting House. Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold. He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford: [...] "An unjust sentence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust sentence on me." [...] He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, [...] "but I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that their liberty and freedom consists in having government... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things." [...] He continued, [...] "I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 9, {{two days}} before the Iraq {{commanding}} General David Petraeus addressed the Senate, Biden stated that, [...] "I really respect him, and I think he's dead flat wrong [...] ". He criticized the president, arguing, [...] "This president has no plan – how to win and/or how to leave". During the September 11 testimony by the General, Biden stated that the question to be asked to determine progress was [...] "Are we any closer to a lasting political settlement in Iraq at the national level today than we were when the surge began eight months ago?" [...] He answered his own question by stating [...] "In my judgment, I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> based on my experience and my observation here, as well as in-country, the answer to... questions is no." [...] After the testimony concluded, Biden and other Democrats were criticized for their conduct during the deliberations. In the following weeks Biden would continue with these arguments while campaigning.|$|E
500|$|While {{making his}} way there he ran into the French fleet on 9 June, the French having sailed from Toulon some days earlier and headed east along the coast. Despite {{pressing}} on sail Speedy was overrun and captured. Eyre was taken aboard one of the French ships, and later transferred to the flagship of the fleet's commander, Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin. Martin {{asked him if he}} had heard of the decree from the National Convention which declared that 'no quarter should be given to either the English or the Hanoverians'. Eyre replied that they had not, on which he was told by Martin that [...] "...I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that it is now un guerre à mort and if I had been the first to come alongside of you, I should have instantly sent you to the bottom." [...] At this point the main British fleet was seen approaching, and Eyre was hurried back to the first ship he had been brought onto, and the French hurried into Gourjean roads, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E

500|$|... "She is enigmatic but I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I {{never had}} a bad {{experience}} because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wagner {{would later}} {{describe}} his last days in Zurich as [...] "a veritable Hell".

2500|$|I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you...</b> {{that what}} we have got is an attempt to {{substitute}} the rule of the mob for the rule of law, and it must not succeed. [...] It must not succeed.

2500|$|After the Soviet Union {{broke apart}} in the early 1990s, Leningrad reverted to its {{original}} name of Saint Petersburg, and a private delegation visited Ilyinsky while he served on Palm Beach City Council {{to ask him to}} return to Russia to claim the throne as tsar.

2500|$|A Cychrus rostratus once {{squirted}} into my eye & gave me extreme pain; & I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{what happened}} to me {{on the banks of the}} Cam in my early entomological days; under a piece of bark I found two carabi (I forget which) & caught one in each hand, when lo & behold I saw a sacred Panagæus crux major; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, & to lose Panagæus was out of the question, so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust & pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat & I lost both Carabi & Panagæus! ...|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the first}} time an organic {{compound}} was artificially synthesized from inorganic starting materials, without the involvement of living organisms. [...] The results of this experiment implicitly discredited vitalism— the theory that the chemicals of living organisms are fundamentally different from those of inanimate matter. [...] This insight was important for the development of organic chemistry. His discovery prompted Wöhler to write triumphantly to Berzelius: [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I can make urea without the use of kidneys, either man or dog. Ammonium cyanate is urea." [...] In fact, this was incorrect. These are two different chemicals, which are in chemical equilibrium heavily favoring urea under standard conditions. Regardless, with his discovery, Wöhler secured a place among the pioneers of organic chemistry.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1944, {{all of the}} Resistance governments {{agreed to}} accept the {{authority}} of the Free French government based in Algiers (until 1962 Algeria was considered to be part of France) and the Resistance was renamed FFI (Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur-Forces of the Interior). The Germans refused to accept the resistance as legitimate opponents and any résistant captured faced the prospect of torture and/or execution as the Germans maintained that the Hague and Geneva conventions did not apply to the resistance. By designating the resistance as part of the French armed forces was intended to provide the Resistance with legal protection and allow the French to threaten the Germans with the possibility of prosecution for war crimes. The designation did not help. For example, the résistante Sindermans was arrested in Paris on 24 February 1944 after she was found to be carrying forged papers. As she recalled: [...] "Immediately, they handcuffed me and took me to be interrogated. Getting no reply, they slapped in the face with such force that I fell from the chair. Then they whipped me with a rubber hose, full in the face. The interrogation began at 10 o'clock in the morning and ended at 11 o'clock that night. I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I had been pregnant for three months".|$|E
