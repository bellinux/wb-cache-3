40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{illustrates}} {{the experiences of}} essential medicine management in providing cure and care to victims of Pakistan’s 2005 earthquake in a safe, rational and effective mode. The health interventions assured access to essential medicine, sustained supply, inventory control through a computerized logistic support system and rational use of medicines. World Health Organization Pakistan outlined modalities for acceptance of donated medicines, assisted in speedy procurement of <b>medicines</b> <b>and</b> designed customized kits. Proper storage of medicines at controlled temperature was ensured in warehousing facilities in 12 locations. A steady supply of <b>medicines</b> <b>and</b> their consumption without stock-outs in the 56 first-level care facilities of calamity-hit areas helped to ascertain the average consumption and cost of essential <b>medicines</b> <b>and</b> supplies for the catchment population. Tools for quantification <b>and</b> forecasting of <b>medicines</b> <b>and</b> supplies were developed <b>and</b> shared. <b>Medicines</b> <b>and</b> medical supplies were efficiently used resulting in minimum wastag...|$|R
