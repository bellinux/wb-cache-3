40|$|Work in the {{paradigm}} of the quantum fluctuation theorems of Crooks and Jarzynski is determined by projective <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> energy {{at the beginning and}} end of the force protocol. In analogy to classical systems, we consider an alternative definition of work given by the integral <b>of</b> the supplied <b>power</b> determined by integrating up the results <b>of</b> repeated <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> the instantaneous <b>power</b> during the force protocol. We observe that such a definition of work, in spite of taking account of the process dependence, has different possible values and statistics from the work determined by the conventional two energy measurement approach (TEMA). In the limit <b>of</b> many projective <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> the system's dynamics is frozen in the power measurement basis due to the quantum Zeno effect leading to statistics only trivially dependent on the force protocol. In general the Jarzynski relation is not satisfied except for the case when the instantaneous power operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian at all times. We also consider properties of the joint statistics of power-based definition of work and TEMA work in protocols where both values are determined. This allows us to quantify their correlations. Relaxing the projective measurement condition, weak continuous <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> are considered within the stochastic master equation formalism. Even in this scenario the power-based work statistics is in general not able to reproduce qualitative features of the TEMA work statistics. Comment: 26 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
