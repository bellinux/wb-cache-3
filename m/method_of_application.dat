5|$|Pesticides {{are applied}} to crops by {{agricultural}} aircraft, tractor-mounted crop sprayers or as seed dressings to control pests. However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application of pesticides may be detrimental in the longer term.|$|E

The objective was to quantify, in relation to three <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer-nitrogen, total dry matter, fresh root yield, accumulated nitrogen and apparent recovery of fertilizer-nitrogen by the cassava genotypes, Afisiafi and Akwetey, grown under rainfed condition in the coastal savannah environment of Ghana. The two cassava 1 genotypes were grown on the field under rainfed condition and 60 kg N ha was split-applied using 1 spot, banding and broadcasting <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer-nitrogen <b>application.</b> Additionally, 60 kg P ha and 1 1 90 kg K ha were broadcast. The mean total dry matter ranged from 23. 1 to 29. 5 t ha, mean fresh root yield 1 1 ranged from 35. 3 to 39. 2 t ha, the mean accumulated nitrogen ranged from 168. 1 to 201. 1 kg ha and mean apparent fertilizer-nitrogen recovery ranged from 39. 1 to 40. 3 % for the spot, banding and broadcasting <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer-nitrogen <b>application.</b> Total dry matter, fresh root yield, accumulated nitrogen and apparent fertilizernitrogen recovery were the lowest for the spot <b>application</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer-nitrogen. However, the effects of banding and broadcasting of fertilizer-nitrogen on the cassava genotypes were similar. In spite of the 18 months that the cassava genotypes took to mature, the apparent fertilizer-nitrogen recovery {{could not be more}} than 50 % for the banding and broadcasting <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer-nitrogen <b>application.</b> This could be attributed to the shallow rooting characteristics of cassava, in which case nitrogen moved below the 60 cm soil depth might not be available to the crop.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine efficacy of edible coating of carrageenan and cinnamon oil to enhance the shelf life of chicken meat stored under refrigeration conditions. Materials and Methods: Chicken breast was coated with carrageenan and cinnamon oil by three <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> viz., spraying brushing and dipping. The coated meat was evaluated for drip loss, pH, thiobarbituric acid number (TBA), tyrosine value (TV) extract release volume (ERV), Warner-Bratzler shear force value (WBSFV), instrumental color, microbiological, and sensory qualities as per standard procedures. Results: There was a significant difference observed for physicochemical parameters (pH, TBA, TV, ERV, drip loss and WBSFV) and microbiological analysis between storage periods in all the samples and between the control and treatments throughout the storage period but samples did not differed significantly for hunter color scores. However, {{there was no significant difference}} among three <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> throughout the storage period though dipping had a lower rate of increase. A progressive decline in mean sensory scores was recorded along with the increase in storage time. Conclusion: The carrageenan and cinnamon edible coating was found to be a good alternative to enhance the shelf life of chicken meat under refrigeration conditions. It was also observed from study that dipping <b>method</b> <b>of</b> the <b>application</b> had comparatively higher shelf life than other <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>application...</b>|$|R
