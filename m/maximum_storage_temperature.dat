50|$|Hundreds of {{millions}} of tonnes of wheat, corn, soybean, rice and other grains as sorghum, sunflower seeds, rapeseed/canola, barley, oats, etc., are dried in grain dryers. In the main agricultural countries, drying comprises the reduction of moisture from about 17-30%w/w to values between 8 and 15%w/w, depending on the grain. The final moisture content for drying must be adequate for storage. The more oil the grain has, the lower its storage moisture content will be (though its initial moisture for drying will also be lower). Cereals are often dried to 14% w/w, while oilseeds, to 12.5% (soybeans), 8% (sunflower) and 9% (peanuts). Drying is carried out as a requisite for safe storage, in order to inhibit microbial growth. However, low temperatures in storage are also highly recommended to avoid degradative reactions and, especially, the growth of insects and mites. A good <b>maximum</b> <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> is about 18 °C.|$|E

40|$|Criteria for interim {{dry storage}} of DOE owned spent nuclear fuels {{will be based}} on a {{combination}} of technical, regulatory, and political requirements. These requirements have not been fully established but will include issues such as the necessity for monitoring the fuel, retrievability of the fuel, maintenance of final disposal options, siting of interim disposal facilities (will the fuels at each site remain on that site throughout the interim disposal period?), and interfacing with the International Atomic Energy Agency over inspectability of the highly enriched fuels in the inventory. Regardless of the other requirement issues, the technical storage criteria are likely to vary with fuel type and will include: (a) a fuel specific <b>maximum</b> <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> coupled to; (b) a specific storage environment (for example, Helium gas with less than xx ppm moisture); (c) a mass limit for fissionable isotopes; and (d) provisions for prestorage characterization and, if necessary, segregation of the fuel based on the established condition of the fuel. Each of these criteria has several associated technical issues and there are significant interactions among the criteria. This white paper summarizes many of the technical issues which must be resolved in order to develop functional and design specification for the interim dry storage for DOE owned spent nuclear fuels...|$|E

40|$|Smoked {{vacuum-packed}} trout fillets {{have won}} {{importance in the}} market {{over the last few}} years, especially because of the increasing production in aqua cultures. According to the fish regulations (Fischhygiene-Verordnung 1994) fish processing facturies have to establish the principles of the HACCP-system for this potentially hazardous product. Similar control-plans were laid down also for the food trade in the ordinance about food hygiene (Lebensmittelhygiene-Verordnung 1997). Here, the most important control point is the maintenance of the cold chain according to the declared temperature in order to control the multiplying of spoiling bacteria and pathogenous microorganisms. The aim of the thesis was to estimate the hazard of insufficient cold storage. First, this study determines the hygienic state of smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets that were taken from fish processing plants, wholesale trade and retail markets. Then, the storage temperatures in chilled cabinets of food handling establishments were controlled by long-term measurements. Afterwards, challenge tests were carried out in order to assess the influence of different temperature conditions on the product quality and shelf life. The hazard caused by growth of L. monocytogenes and toxin production of Cl. botlinum was discussed. The results are summarized as follows: 1.) The median for the total aerobic bacterial count of 28 samples taken in fish processing plants was log 3, 10 cfu/g. The market anlysis of 44 samples bought in wholesale trade and 76 samples bought in retail shops showed a median of log 6, 38 cfu/g (wholesale) and log 6, 80 cfu/g (retail) for the total count. The predominant spoilage bacteria belonged to the group of lactic acid bacteria and Pseudomonas spp., followed by coliform bacteria and yeasts. 2.) L. monocytogenes was isolated in 43 (31 %) smoked trouts from wholesale trade and retail markets. 42 % of the L. monocytogenes-positive samples showed levels between log 2 and log 4 L. monocytogenes/g, in 12 % of the samples levels of more than log 4 L. monocytogenes/g were detected. 3.) The long-term measurements of the storage temperature proved insufficient cooling in 9 of 12 chilled cabinets. On the one hand the storage temperature remained constant over the whole period of time but exceeded the declared temperature partly extreme. In other hand the smoked trout fillets were stored at extremely varying temperatures. The labeled storage temperature was mainly exceeded during the defrosting period. Furthermore, the long-term determination showed that neither spot checks of the storage temperature by single measurement nor integrated displays provide meaningful results, because the defrosting can not be recorded. 4.) A high total bacterial load (> log 6 cfu/g) was reached at 3, 5 °C after 3 weeks storing of commercially produced smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets. A comparable result was attained within 8 days when the samples were stored at 11 °C. In samples stored at 6 °C, interrupted by one-hour storage at 11 °C, the limit of log 5 cfu/g was exceeded between the fifth and eighth day of storage. The minimum shelf life at a constant temperature of 4 °C should be fixed upon 14 days. 5.) Within the usual labeled shelf life of more than 3 weeks L. monocytogenes and Cl. botulinum will grow to high levels or produce toxin in smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets, if temperature abuse occurs (f. e., storage temperature of 10 °C). Therefore, for this potentially hazardous product a <b>maximum</b> <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> of 4 °C has to be settled. This indicates also a contribution to consumer protection. Furthermore, it is concluded from {{the results of this study}} that the trade has to be more responsible for the control point "storage temperature". <br...|$|E

40|$|Safe interim {{dry storage}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) must be {{maintained}} {{for a minimum of}} twenty years according to the Code of Federal Regulations. The most important variable that must be regulated by dry storage licensees in order to meet current safety standards is the temperature of the SNF. The two currently accepted models to define the <b>maximum</b> allowable initial <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> for SNF are based on the diffusion controlled cavity growth (DCCG) failure mechanism proposed by Raj and Ashby. These models may not give conservative temperature limits. Some have suggested using a strain-based failure model to predict the maximum allowable temperatures, but we have shown that this is not applicable to the SNF as long as DCCG is the assumed failure mechanism. Although the two accepted models are based on the same fundamental failure theory (DCCG), the researchers who developed the models made different assumptions, including selection {{of some of the most}} critical variables in the DCCG failure equation. These inconsistencies are discussed together with recommended modifications to the failure models based on more recent data...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Background: Since 1999 WHO has {{tracked the}} {{procurement}} of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for common infections, such as HIV, and has reported {{a significant increase}} in usage. In 1999 less than 40 % of all HIV diagnoses around the world were performed with rapid tests whereas the remaining 60 % were conducted with laboratory-based tests such as ELISAs. By 2009 over 80 % of HIV diagnoses had transitioned to using RDTs. Many of these tests abide by the ASSURED criteria, which outline standards for the evaluation of point-of-care diagnostics. Although these criteria endorse important characteristics such as low cost and rapid time-to-results, they do not provide quantitative measures to compare similar tests or guide RDT developers. In this analysis we aim to determine how different countries select HIV RDT(s), and to parse out which characteristics are responsible for their decisions. Understanding what drives the purchase and use of current HIV RDTs can help inform future designs and specifications for test developers. Methods: We analyzed data from The Global Fund's Price and Quality Reporting (PQR) database from January 2010 to January 2014. The sample consisted of 945 purchase records of HIV rapid diagnostic tests, including order date, purchasing country, and the number of tests purchased per order. The main independent variable was unit cost per test (in USD). Linear regression with random effects on country was used {{to examine the relationship between}} test purchase, a proxy for test usage, and test cost. Models were adjusted for country random effects and country and test-level covariates. Findings: This study included 945 purchase records of 38 different HIV RDTs from 93 countries. Our exploratory analysis showed that the characteristics that drive test purchase differ across a variety of settings. As cost is increased by just one $ 1. 00 overall purchase across all settings falls by 18. 7 % (95 % CI: − 25. 4 to − 16. 0 %). Other important driving characteristics were test time, <b>maximum</b> test <b>storage</b> <b>temperature,</b> and whether or not the test required additional equipment to run. When observations are stratified by country income level, the major driving factor is test cost and the degree of influence changes across strata. For low-income countries, every $ 1. 00 increase in test cost decreases test purchases by 62. 1 % (95 % CI: − 155 to − 39. 4 %). For high-income countries this decrease is only 10. 4 % (95 % CI: − 24. 7 to − 2. 7 %). Stratification by country HIV prevalence, high vs. low, again showed cost was a major driving factor, while test time, <b>maximum</b> test <b>storage</b> <b>temperature,</b> and whether or not the test required additional equipment to run were also significant indicators. For all of the analyses, test accuracy — sensitivity and specificity — was not found to significantly influence test purchase within this dataset. Findings: The ASSURED criteria are a good first step toward evaluating diagnostics for a variety of settings but this work presents the first quantitative assessment of which characteristics influence the purchase and usage of HIV RDTs. Overall, cost was a major driving factor, but the degree of its influence, and whether or not other factors were also important, varies between settings. This exploratory analysis can serve as a step toward better understanding what drives HIV RDT usage and help researchers and test developers design future tests that focus on these important characteristics...|$|R
