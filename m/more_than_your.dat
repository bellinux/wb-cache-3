500|$|However, some of {{the reviews}} were more negative. PALGN's Jeremy Jastrzab opined that [...] "Darkwatch gives vampires, undead, cowboys and plenty of bullets to fire. But that's about it. Otherwise, Darkwatch is a fairly {{standard}} affair that's worth a rental." [...] According to Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, [...] "Darkwatch doesn't amount to much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> run-of-the mill first-person shooter." [...] Eurogamer's Martin Coxall called it [...] "a generic and quickly tiresome shooter, with a contrived premise which, unfortunately, does nothing to elevate it." ...|$|E
500|$|NME {{reviewer}} Dele Fadele saw My Bloody Valentine as the [...] "blueprint" [...] for the shoegaze genre, and wrote: [...] "with 'Loveless' you could've {{expected the}} Irish / English partnership {{to succumb to}} self-parody or mimic The Scene That's Delighted To Eat Quiche [...] But no, 'Loveless' fires a silver-coated bullet into the future, daring all-comers to try and recreate its mixture of moods, feelings, emotion, styles and, yes, innovations." [...] While Fadele expressed some disappointment that the group seemed to disassociate themselves from dance music and reggae basslines, he concluded [...] "'Loveless' ups the ante, and, however decadent one might find the idea of elevating other human beings to deities, My Bloody Valentine, failings and all, deserve <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> respect." [...] Melody Maker writer Simon Reynolds praised the album, and wrote that Loveless [...] " [...] how unique, how peerless MBV are." [...] He declared, [...] "Along with Mercury Rev's Yerself is Steam, 'Loveless' is the outermost, innermost, uttermost rock record of 1991." [...] Reynolds noted that his only criticism was that [...] "while My Bloody Valentine have amplified and refined what they already were, they've failed to mutate or leap into any kind of beyond." [...] In a review that also covered Chapterhouse and Creation labelmates Velvet Crush, Rolling Stone reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, [...] "Despite the record's intense ability to disorient—this is real do-not-adjust-your-set stuff—the effect is strangely uplifting. Loveless oozes a sonic balm that first embraces and then softly pulverizes the frantic stress of life." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that the band had [...] "written a new vocabulary for the guitar, and perhaps given it another 10 years of life as rock`s central instrument." [...] Spin gave Loveless a mixed review with writer Jim Greer noting that the album's songs are [...] "standard-ish and dull" [...] and concluded that he felt [...] "The warped music is a cool idea and I recommend the album—but {{not on the basis}} of the singing or the songs".|$|E

2500|$|However, Verdi had {{not lost}} sight of Corsaro at all, as is {{demonstrated}} in a letter he wrote to Piave. [...] Impatient because of the delays, Piave had asked for his libretto {{to be returned to}} him in order that he might fulfill another commitment. Verdi was shocked: [...] "Give you back Il corsaro, that Corsaro which has always fascinated me and which I've thought about so much, and which you've put into verse with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> usual care?" [...] The composer continues to explain details of the work on the music he has already done, but notes [...] "I still have to write the opera for Lucca." [...] Piave relented, and he moved ahead on Macbeth 's libretto. But, {{by the end of the}} year, when Lucca and the British impresario, Benjamin Lumley were raising the issue of the London contract, Verdi replied that he found Il corsaro [...] "dull (freddo) and theatrically ineffective".|$|E
2500|$|Merchants {{organized}} {{themselves into}} groups called Sattu or Nikamam. Stone inscriptions at Mangulam (c. 200 BCE) and pottery inscriptions found at Kodumanal refer to merchant guilds as nikamam {{and the members}} of the guilds as nikamattor. These findings suggest that merchant guilds were established at several industrial and trade centres of ancient Tamil country. Many of these merchant associations acted in union in their public activities. They were autonomous, meaning that they enjoyed freedom from state interference but also suffered from the lack of state backing. Merchants were expected to abide by a code of conduct, which was: [...] "Refuse to take <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> due and never stint giving to others their due". Therefore, they went about running their business by openly announcing the profit they were aiming at, known as Utiyam. The mercantile community of Tamilakam was aware of elementary banking operations. Lending through houses specializing in monetary transactions and fixation of rates were common. This was, evidently, necessitated by the extensive overseas trade. Accountants were in demand in view of monetary transactions and considerable trading activity. Merchant groups from Madurai and Karur made endowments, or donations, as attested by inscriptions found in Alagarmalai (c. 1st century BCE) and Pugalur (c. 3rd century CE). These inscriptions also mention that the various commodities traded by [...] such merchants [...] included cloth, salt, oil, plowshares, sugar and gold.|$|E
2500|$|An Essay {{begins with}} a series of letters in which Makin {{establishes}} her audience with her original appeal to “all Ingenious and Virtuous Ladies, more especially to her Highness the Lady Mary, eldest Daughter to his Royal Highness the Duke of York" [...] (Makin 1673). In the introductory epistle, Makin admits that to challenge customs, to imply that women are reasonable creatures who will benefit from learning, is a bold attempt and she expects to meet opposition {{while at the same time}} claiming that the patronage of the Royal Highness will be a form of protection. Here, in Makin's exordium, through the use of kairos, she appeals to her audience's interest and sympathy. While her audience is both male and female, her emotional appeal, the pathos of her treatise, is directed at women, for she writes: “I expect to meet with many scoffs and taunts from inconsiderate and illiterate men, that prize their own lusts and pleasure <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> profit and content” (Makin 1673). She goes on to state: “I shall be the less concerned at these, so long as I am in your favor; and this discourse may be a weapon in your hands to defend yourselves, whilst you endeavor to polish your souls, that you may glorify God" [...] (Makin 1673). She further emphasises [...] "ladies" [...] as her target audience: “I hope I shall not need to beg the patience of ladies to peruse this pamphlet: I have bespoken and do expect your patronage, because it is your cause I plead against an ill custom, prejudicial to you, which men will not willingly suffer to be broken” (Makin 1673).|$|E
