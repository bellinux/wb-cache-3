5000|$|The Ace {{family is}} a much simpler type of Rockman {{that does not have}} effects and uses a single 9-volt battery or power supply. The Guitar and Bass Ace were first {{released}} in 1990. The <b>Metal</b> <b>Ace</b> was released in 1994. The Guitar Ace and <b>Metal</b> <b>Ace</b> have identical controls, but the <b>Metal</b> <b>Ace</b> is advertised to have a [...] "brighter" [...] sound. The amplifier distortion is toggled using the [...] "cln/dist" [...] button. The character of the distortion can be changed with the [...] "semi/hvy" [...] button. Semi-distortion behaves much like the [...] "edge" [...] setting is described to, in the Rockman and X100 product. The Bass Ace has the most spartan controls, including mid and treble boost buttons.|$|E

40|$|The Green and Golden Bell frog Litoria aureo is {{in major}} decline in Australia, where its {{distribution}} is now confined {{mainly to the}} east coast of New South Wales (NSW). Infection by the newly emerged amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been identified as one of the main threats affecting L. aurea. Surprisingly, some of the sites in NSW sustaining the largest populations of this species are industrial and urban habitats that are often disturbed and polluted, which could protect L. aurea from chytrid infection if pollution had fungicidal capacity. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the trace metal concentration of several L. aurea breeding sites in the Sydney and IIlawarra regions of NSW and to evaluate the fungicidal efficacy of the main " 2 Ì† 7 <b>ace</b> <b>metals</b> identified. Selected L. aurea sites were sampled throughout the breeding season (September to February) to establish the concentration of trace metals in both surface sediment and waters. Physico-chemical parameters including pH and salinity were also measured. Of the trace metals identified, copper and zinc were consistently elevated across sites. Over 50...|$|R
