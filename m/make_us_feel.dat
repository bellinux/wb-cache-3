From 16 August 144 RAC regularly worked with 153rd (Highland) Brigade of 51st Highland. 'On arriving at Brigade Headquarters, Major Secretan {{found that he was}} to support the 1st Gordons, the beginning of a long association between B Squadron and that battalion... this was really the beginning of our close connection with 153 Infantry Brigade, an association which was to continue {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Each infantry battalion also grew accustomed to being supported by the same squadron and in this way very close ties of confidence and friendship were established between A Squadron and the 5th Black Watch, B squadron and the 1st Gordons, and between C Squadron and the 5/7th Gordons... In order to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> part of the family, the 51st Highland Division asked us to wear the famous HD flash and issued every man in the brigade with one, a gesture which was very much appreciated'.|$|E

And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like we are at home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, some reviewers found Jawss {{description}} of the shark attacks entertaining. John Spurling of the New Statesman asserted that while the [...] "characterisation of the humans is fairly rudimentary", the shark [...] "is done with exhilarating and alarming skill, and every scene in which it appears is imagined at a special pitch of intensity." [...] Christopher Lehmann-Haupt praised the novel in a short review for The New York Times, highlighting the [...] "strong plot" [...] and [...] "rich thematic substructure." [...] The Washington Posts Robert F. Jones described Jaws as [...] "much more than a gripping fish story. It is a tightly written, tautly paced study," [...] which [...] "forged and touched a metaphor that still makes us tingle whenever we enter the water." [...] New York Magazine reviewer Eliot Fremont-Smith found the novel [...] "immensely readable" [...] {{despite the lack of}} [...] "memorable characters or much plot surprise or originality"; Fremont-Smith wrote that Benchley [...] "fulfills all expectations, provides just enough civics and ecology to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> good, and tops it off with a really terrific and grisly battle scene".|$|E

500|$|The song's bleak lyrics were {{explained}} by Marker as {{a mockery of}} the angsty [...] " [...] thing" [...] themes prevalent in mid-1990s alternative rock songs, as well as a self-deprecating reference to Garbage's own dark lyrics, with Manson explaining that the song was [...] "a dig at ourselves because we like records that don't <b>make</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> very happy, and at this so-called 'alternative' scene of 'we're so weird and more wonderful than everybody else'". Vig added that [...] "'Only Happy When It Rains' was about what happened with grunge and the angst-filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene. With us there's self-deprecation, we have to poke fun at ourselves because we're so incredibly obsessive about the songs and the lyrics, which makes us filled with self-loathing, hurhur." [...] Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song [...] "Happy When It Rains" [...] (1987) and Manson's own Scottish psyche. Lyrically, Manson described [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] as [...] "about wanting love but knowing life will always get in the way.... yet not being obliterated by that. It's a song for people that know {{what it is like to}} live on the dark side of life. It's about devotion but a different kind. A devotion to the truth and to freedom... and to hell with the consequences." ...|$|E

Hansen, a specialist in the Maya and assistant professor of archaeology at Idaho State University. As director of the Mirador Basin Project, he works to preserve a large swath of the Guatemalan rain forest and its Maya ruins.

Scholars and critics have not yet taken the full measure of contemplation as an art that is related to the purpose of all scholarly activity [...] to see things as they really are... Using narrative, parable and exposition, Eiseley has the uncanny ability to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> that we are accompanying him on a journey into {{the very heart of the}} universe.

He went on to write an article called Under the Lucky Star for Pink-Pages, a National LGBT Magazine in India, where he came out to the readers and later on, also to his parents through the article. In his article he writes, [...] "There is an underlying sense of security that only the walls of the closet can ensure. But then follows the phase of suffocation. The walls that once protected us begin to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> restricted. And what follows is the [...] "end of self denial". This is when it all gets better." [...] He went on to write another article the following year for Pink-Pages called 'Growing Up Gay', where he spoke of how contrary to the reactions of people, growing up gay in India isn't half as bad. He continued to write for online forums that same year including 'That Time I Chose To be Gay' for Youth Youniverse and 'Miscellaneous Miley' for Artists at Work Productions' blog.|$|E
2500|$|Ed Sheeran {{has spoken}} about his support her Sandé and her music, {{saying that she}} has {{spent a lot of}} time on the record and that it could be as big as Adele's second album, 21, which has sold over 27 million records worldwide. Sandé {{revealed}} that she wanted to bring poetry back into music, as it has been lost. The songs which are currently being released are for the [...] "moment" [...] as they <b>make</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> good and we can dance to them, Sandé said. She said that Our Version of Events will see poetry lyrics, as she intends to bring them back into fashion. She said; Great songwriters come along quite rarely, but when I listen to Tracy Chapman or Joni Mitchell, these are people who pay attention to the lyric and are precise about it. I feel that has been put second to having a cool producer or whether the kids will like it. She said that the music industry is hard to get into, but once you are in, it is very loyal. In the recording studio, Syco Music heard some of Sandé's songs which they wanted, but she refused and told them she wanted to keep them for her own album. They later asked her to write for some of their artists, and Leona Lewis went into the studio with her and Naughty Boy to record for a couple of weeks, and she said that her and Lewis had a lot in common. She also said that Lewis has a phenomenal voice and she was lovely.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half stars, {{pointing}} out the CGI as the apex achievement of the film. He labelled it [...] "a beautifully rendered, visually arresting take on Rudyard Kipling's oft-filmed tales" [...] but found the musical numbers to be trivial, saying that without the musical numbers, the film might have been a more exhilarating streamlined adventure. Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan remarked that [...] "The Jungle Book is the kind of family film calculated to make even those without families wish they had one to take along." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, labeling it scary and thrilling, yet unique and unforgettable, and adding that it [...] "fills us with something rare in movies today — a sense of wonder." [...] The Village Voices Bilge Ebiri hailed the film as fast and light and that it [...] "manages to be just scary enough to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> the danger of solitude {{in the middle of a}} massive jungle, but never indulgent or gratuitous." [...] The New York Times Manohla Dargis was less enthusiastic. Cath Clarke of Time Out compared Elba's character of Shere Khan to Scar from The Lion King, calling him [...] "baddie of the year." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com also had high praise for Elba's portrayal of Shere Khan stating: [...] "His loping menace is envisioned so powerfully that he'd be scary no matter what, but the character becomes a great villain through imaginative empathy. We understand and appreciate his point-of-view, even though carrying it out would mean the death of Mowgli." ...|$|E
