50|$|Integrated {{injection}} logic (IIL, I2L, or I2L) is a {{class of}} digital circuits built with multiple collector bipolar junction transistors (BJT). When introduced it had speed comparable to TTL yet was almost as low power as CMOS, making it ideal for use in VLSI (and larger) integrated circuits. Although the logic voltage levels are very close (High: 0.7V, Low: 0.2V), I2L has high noise immunity because it operates by current instead of voltage. It is sometimes also known as <b>merged</b> <b>transistor</b> <b>logic.</b>|$|E

So in this paper we are going to propose and design the implementation of low-energy asynchronous logic topology using SAPTL. In this paper we present two different self timed approaches like Bundled Data and Dual rail handshake protocol. The proposed self-timed SAPTL architectures provide robust and efficient asynchronous computation using a glitch-free protocol to avoid possible dynamic timing hazards. Results obtained with this paper show that the self-timed SAPTL with dual-rail protocol exhibits energy-delay characteristics better than synchronous and bundled data self-timed approaches in 90 -nm CMOS. starting to limit the minimum energy that static CMOS circuits can achieve.
