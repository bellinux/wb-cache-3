40|$|Thermo King as a {{supplier}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>refrigeration</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is interested in}} {{more information about the}} airflow distribution inside a refrigerated trailer in various loading conditions to optimise the performance of the refrigeration units. A more efficient way and/or more uniform way of keeping the internal environment inside the refrigerated box at the required conditions will increase the quality of the cargo as well as causing less damage to the environment. The objective of this project is to develop a testing environment that makes it possible to conduct airflow tests for the purpose of learning more about the internal airflow of a trailer. This test environment will be {{in the form of an}} hydraulic transparent test rig representing a scaled model o f a refrigeration system. The test environment must be able to simulate multiple unit configurations in the form of different airflow volumes, and different configurations of air inlet and outlet positions. Different cargo configurations inside the trailer will be used to simulate different types of loads. Secondly, advice and recommendations on the improvement of airflow as well as ideas for further research will be discussed. It is recommended that the project be continued by future researchers to obtain more extensive results from the simulation environment developed and created during this project. Real flow investigation and improvement in airflow distribution should be developed and tested to enable Thermo King to make a more efficient, competitive and more environmentally friendly refrigeration unit...|$|E

40|$|The {{commercial}} food sector, including agriculture, food manufacture {{transport and}} retailing {{is responsible for}} 22 % of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Food distribution and retail accounts for approximately one third of this, with food transport which includes motive power and refrigeration estimated {{to be responsible for}} 1. 8 % of total emissions [1]. Road transport <b>refrigeration</b> <b>equipment</b> are required to operate reliably in much harsher environments than stationary <b>refrigeration</b> <b>equipment.</b> Due to the wide range of operating conditions and constraints imposed by available space and weight, transport <b>refrigeration</b> <b>equipment</b> have lower efficiencies than stationary systems. This, coupled to rapidly increasing use of refrigerated transport arising from the much wider range of transported goods, home delivery and greater quality expectations, is placing considerable pressures on the food industry to reduce the energy consumption of refrigerated transport. This report provides a review of food transport refrigeration and recent research into the development and application of alternative technologies to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R
