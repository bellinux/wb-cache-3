5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>system</b> and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>system</b> is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the naming}} scheme as {{originally}} developed, these substems mostly {{consist of a}} consonant, a vowel, then another consonant. The final letter may be dropped if the resulting name {{would be difficult to}} pronounce otherwise. Examples include -ci(r)- for the circulatory system, -li(m)- for the immune system (lim stands for lymphocyte) and -ne(r)- for the nervous system. The final letter is usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting the <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>system</b> ever received an INN. Combination of target and source substems results in endings like -limumab (immune system, human) or -ciximab (circulatory system, chimeric, consonant r dropped).|$|E

25|$|Fluoroquinolones are not {{licensed}} by the FDA for use in children due {{to the risk of}} fatalities as well as permanent injury to the <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>system,</b> with two exceptions. Ciprofloxacin is being licensed for the treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and Pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli and Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure) and levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure). However, the Fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Quinolones are {{contraindicated}} if {{a patient}} has epilepsy, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, QT prolongation, pre-existing CNS lesions, or CNS inflammation, or the patient has suffered a stroke. They are best avoided in the athlete population. Safety concerns exist for fluoroquinolone use during pregnancy, so they are contraindicated unless no other safe alternative antibiotic exists. However, one meta-analysis looking at the outcome of pregnancies involving quinolone use in the first trimester found no increased risk of malformations. They are also contraindicated in children due to the risks of damage to the <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>system.</b> Their use in children is not absolutely contraindicated, however. For certain severe infections where other antibiotics are not an option, their use can be justified. Quinolones should also not be given to people with a known hypersensitivity to the drug class.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} is {{the patient}} has to hold still {{for long periods of}} time in a noisy, cramped space while the imaging is performed. Claustrophobia severe enough to terminate the MRI exam is reported in up to 5% of patients. Recent improvements in magnet design including stronger magnetic fields (3 teslas), shortening exam times, wider, shorter magnet bores and more open magnet designs, have brought some relief for claustrophobic patients. However, for magnets with equivalent field strengths, there is often a trade-off between image quality and open design. MRI has great benefit in imaging the brain, spine, and <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>system.</b> The use of MRI is currently contraindicated for patients with pacemakers, cochlear implants, some indwelling medication pumps, certain types of cerebral aneurysm clips, metal fragments in the eyes and some metallic hardware due to the powerful magnetic fields and strong fluctuating radio signals to which the body is exposed. Areas of potential advancement include functional imaging, cardiovascular MRI, and MRI-guided therapy.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLocomotion is a {{behaviour}} {{resulting from the}} interaction of the nervous and <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>systems</b> and the environment. However, the <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>systems</b> of some terrestrial mammals present an intrinsic ability to realize a dynamic stable locomo- tion. Current anthropomorphic passive walkers demonstrate that a pure mechanical system with legs and arms is able to walk down an inclined plane. Numerical simulations confirm that self-stabilization of the mechanics is acting in running too. The necessity to ensure the dynamic stability of a cyclic locomotion set physical constraints to the musculo-skeletal system. A description of the locomotor apparatus with neuromechanical variables like the stiffness – accessible to the experimentation – enables for maintain- ing the number of degrees of freedom of biomechanical models as low as possible. The maximization of the robustness of the mechanical self-stabilization of the models with regard to the body proportions represents for future simulations an optimization criterion that should bring a new light into the comprehension of the body proportions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{workspace}} {{analysis of}} cable-driven parallel manipulators {{has been widely}} studied, where the cables have been considered as ideal force generators. Due to the differences in actuation dynamics, workspace analysis has not been previously conducted for <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, static workspace analysis is performed on the human shoulder with a Hill-type physiological muscle model. The key characteristic of physiological muscles is that its ability to produce force is dependent on its length. Such type of workspace analysis on <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>systems</b> as cable-driven manipulators is proposed for the first time. The generated shoulder workspace is validated by comparing the range of motion to that from benchmarks of human data. The significance of considering physiological muscles is demonstrated by comparing the musculoskeletal workspace with that of systems with ideal force generators. The novel formulation provides a new computational approach to perform workspace analysis for {{a wider range of}} engineered and biological systems. I...|$|R

500|$|DCS is {{classified}} by symptoms. The earliest descriptions of DCS used the terms: [...] "bends" [...] for joint or skeletal pain; [...] "chokes" [...] for breathing problems; and [...] "staggers" [...] for neurological problems. In 1960, Golding et al. introduced a simpler classification {{using the term}} [...] "Type I ('simple')" [...] for symptoms involving only the skin, <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>system,</b> or lymphatic system, and [...] "Type II ('serious')" [...] for symptoms where other organs (such as the central nervous system) are involved. Type II DCS is considered more serious and usually has worse outcomes. This system, with minor modifications, may still be used today. Following changes to treatment methods, this classification is now much less useful in diagnosis, since neurological symptoms may develop after the initial presentation, and both Type I and Type II DCS have the same initial management.|$|E
