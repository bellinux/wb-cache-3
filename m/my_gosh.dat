The song was written with American pop singer Britney Spears in mind, whom Stewart had previously worked with on her 2003 single [...] "Me Against the Music". Stewart and Nash thought that Spears, who had [...] "her personal life... a little out of control" [...] at the time, needed a hit as musical comeback. Spears was working on her fifth album, Blackout, so they sent a copy of the demo to Spears' management.

From E 40 Euclid-Lake Shore to E. 79 Euclid-Lake Shore, they have asked people to evacuate as the fire seems to be in the gas lines. Also, almost the whole N. E. section have [sic] been asked to turn off their gas. I worked late tonight as some of my kids turned out to be “evacuees” [...] one or two, I believe, are now homeless. Then I went to do my volunteer work at 71 st 2 ̆ 6 Hough. Well, we got little or nothing done in dramatics so we tried to keep the kids off the street, anyhow, by having social dancing. Then, we were more of a receiving station than anything else [...] directing people where to go for food, housing, etc. It is pathetic 2 ̆ 6 the poor, of course, bear the “blunt” [sic] of it. I am exhausted. Met Dad 2 ̆ 6 Mom at the Sovereign. (They were visiting [the] Weingartens whose gas is also off) 2 ̆ 6 they took me home. I am upset, dear! But I guess that’s life [...] 2 ̆ 6 life can be brutal! Called your Mom [...] she got panicky thinking I was in the critical area. Then, she asks me if she can help. Gosh, if she can’t control herself, how can she control others? Well, your folks got mail from you, too! Why not me? [...] But I’m sure I’ll hear tomorrow. Amy, also, had mail from Earl. She told Mom. As yet, however, I haven’t been able to contact her! Bubsie, I got good hrs. at work, I think. Every day 10 - 6, except Tues. 8 : 30 - 4 : 30 2 ̆ 6 Sat. 8 - 12 : 30. Not bad, eh what? Must get some sleep [...] more tomorrow. Yours forever, Edith [Transcription ends...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] Saturday night 10 / 28 / 44 In Ukie’s room Dearest Darling, Boy, I {{really did}} work tonight. I wrote either letters or cards to the {{following}} people, either answering mail from them, or asking them why they haven’t written, or, trying to locate their whereabouts: Geo. Miller, Esther Moskowitz, Fred Grail, Sid Raiken, Evelyn Meinkoff, Helen Curley, Mort, Alice Pevsner, Tom Kentes, Jerry Black, Leo Shaw, and Syl Hirshfield. Some of the letters I answered, I’m sending to you. Today we {{received a letter from}} Harriet Faliurin. Ed is still in this country in the midst of changing stations. Also, we received a card from Geo. Miller. He is now a physical exercise instructor at Brooke General Hosp. in the midst of Heaven called San Antonio, Texas. What a lucky, lucky boy, and I think he knows it! At least, he writes about how swell it is down there! I received two letters from you today. One was written 10 / 16, and the other, 10 / 18. However, my darling, if you have written me every day I’m missing many letters from the time you left until about the 14 th of this month. Did you write every day, or, haven’t I received all the mail, as yet? As I write to our friends, I tell them of your change of address. However, sweetheart, what do you mean when you say “APO’s are good for 6 mos. always?” Thanks for Stan’s letter. I read it, copied the new address, and threw it away. I really have nothing to write him, but will send him one of our Xmas cards. Gee sweets [...] you really must have been pretty tired the day you wrote me that I could take a nip out of your “tussie” and you wouldn’t even squawk. I’m going to put that down in my notebook and hold you to it someday, as it has been one of my life-long ambitions, and golly hones, it sure will taste good. I adore you, my dearest one! Honey, I thoroughly enjoy your letters, and I’m particularly glad you notice things that will interest me: for instance, like children. You probably know, no doubt, that the state of a nation can be told by looking at many of their children. No doubt in most of those war devastated countries, the children’s faces show their wants and hopes! I definitely would not like to see any more bloodshed after this war, but honey, I can’t help but hope that this “color question” becomes an issue. Unless minority rights and liberties are insured [sic], what kind of a democracy have we? Okay, don’t answer that [...] it’s known we only have “our form” of gov’t called a democracy. Which reminds me [...] wouldn’t it be {{the worst thing that could}} happen, if Roosevelt carries the majority of votes, but Dewey wins by the electral [sic] votes? Ukie helped out in the nursery today since we were short-staffed. Personally, she likes working with older children as she definitely likes the “teaching angle,” while I prefer the younger ones, because there is where you can mold for a social and emotional angle. I had a half day off, so Uk and I went to the library, and I fished around for plays for my dramatics group, but I was unsuccessful as they don’t have “Janie” or “Junior Miss” in, and I thought of submitting those two to the group for approval. I feel if they can vote on the play they want to do, we’ll get better response. I saw “Hostages” at the library and looked through it, but since it deals with Germany and the Gestapo (right?), I don’t feel like reading it. However, if you really think it is a “super” book, say so, and I’ll read it! Uk has a cold in her head so I’m glad she didn’t have a date for tonight and could stay in bed. Here’s some news (gossip). Shirley Berger Lurie gave birth. However, I understand, that husband, Capt. Lurie, is in a general hospital with some sort of mental trouble! Arnoff was bought out by Jacobson, and now is trying to say he has retired. Since he’s not with Jacobson any longer, his wife and he are not on as good terms as they should be, and people have been smelling the ugly word, “divorce. ” My cousin Maxie, after having his grocery store for about 2 ½ months, decided he is working too hard and now wants to sell it in order to buy a “smoking shop” [...] commonly known as a poolroom. Personally, I think the guy is crazy as I understand the grocery was a “going” business. Oh yes, bought Alma a very nice box of stationary [sic] for her birthday. My back is starting to hurt as I’m sitting on a stool instead of a chair. And anyhow, I guess I’ve just run out of anything more to say in this letter, except that I feel fine, still taking the pills, and hope I lose weight. How do you look <b>my</b> sweets? <b>Gosh,</b> I can just about smell you near me now, and I love it. You know, dearest, I wouldn’t admit it before, but when I think of you, I always thing [sic] of you as when you come off the field in your fatigues, sweating and dirty, with your 5 o’clock shadow [...] you really look very virile, and your hairy chest sparkles with sweat and you seem all aglow, which you probably are with so much prespiration [sic] on you. I adore you, Bubsie [...] and I’m “tickled pink” that you are all mine! I certainly am all yours [...] no doubt about it. Ever yours, Edith [Transcription ends...|$|R

40|$|Transcription begins] At Camp 27 September 1944 My darling Dream-girl, Today I hit the jackpot. I {{received}} a letter from Lollie Black, and 4 letters from you my darling of which 2 were birthday greeting cards. Lollie writes that the town is pretty empty now and that after the war she’d like very much to get together with us. They are a regular couple, aren’t they? I’m going to drop her a line this evening. Adds too, that she saw Bill, Rae and Simma at New Year’s Services at the Temple. Sweetheart, are you getting mail regularly from me? Better get used to that long contemplated absence of mail, my precious. If you get too anxiour [sic] for mail, just drop yourself a letter and sign my name to it. After all, you know my style. (Writing letters as well as other things). Putzie-Pie, your birthday cards were darling. The one of the ship was particularly apropos. Now to relate my daily doings: I attended Yom Kipper Services this morning. Very nice services and attended by quite a congregation. It seems that the closer we get to the war zone that the greater appeal religion has to soldiers. After the services I planned to “laze” around all day long, but I got involved with some court martial cases and it took all my time thereafter. I’m becoming quite an authority on the court martial. After all, I’ve handled so many of them. Adorable wife, I’ve got to break into this letter to tell you how much I idolize you. Buzz, you’re not beautiful; you have a poor shape (part of which is <b>my</b> fault) but <b>gosh</b> you make goose pimples come all over me when I think about you. Why? Because I exist only to be with you forever and ever. Darling, this isn’t flattery, it’s cold, hard facts. This post here offers the men outstanding entertainment. Tonight I say a Broadway cast put on “Panama Hattie” (a stream-lined version). The show was excellent—really first rate. These shows often go overseas to entertain the man [sic]. The show was really 2 ̆ 6 truly professional in every respect. Fast and Funny. Darling, your mail is not censored on its way to me, mine is spot checked on its way to you. N’est-ce pas? I’m glad you got Sanford his ring. It’s a life long gift and something he will cherish always. Are you putting our initials {{on the back of the}} ring? Lovely one, when you finish decorating the room, I would like to have a picture of the room—call in an outside photographer, if necessary, or you might even try your hand at night photography. Speaking about photography—has your camera been repaired? Are you send [sic] me the camera you recently purchased? About my trip to N. Y. there’s not much to write. I went into the city primarily to call you and do some shopping of small items. Sometimes I wonder how I can carry all the stuff I accumulate. Golly! I bought a very fine pocket knife with many features. It contains 2 blades, 1 bottle opener, 1 can opener (very good for “C” rations), 1 awl (to punch holes in leather, etc.) and one cork “puller outer” to pull the cork out from champagne bottles. That’s me, always looking ahead. Sweetheart, we had a good dinner, went to the show (Jarret and me) and then went back to camp. Boy, if you were there, we should have done a lot different—but I’m glad you weren’t there as we’d have gone through some more good-byes and I just don’t have the strength to go through them. Also I may not have been as “good” as I was that Saturday night and may have detracted from that “super” time reputation which I claim. Golly, what an egotist I’m developing to! I remember times though when you were very perturbed with me, too. You know, ever since I (you) put that bracelet on I haven’t taken it off. I’ve received many compliments on it and have developed an ever-growing fondness for it. Thanks again. Bubs, I’m going to begin using V-mail letters as well as the air mail letters. After all, I’ve got to have this stationary [sic] stretch as far as it will go. About your relations with the folks. Don’t be too “chummy-wummy” but just pleasant. My dad is a good Joe so if you can give him a break sometime so much the good. Anything you do I’ll back you up to the hilt—wherever I may be. Give everybody my best regards. Now, about those Xmas cards. I happened to think of Mrs. Hirschfield (Sylvia) who does designing 2 ̆ 6 art work. Why don’t you write her and ask her if she can contact some of her acquaintances to do the job. I’m sure she’ll be able to give you a lead. Bye for now with all my love for you.
