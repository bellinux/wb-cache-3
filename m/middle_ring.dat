The outer ring, which is built of load-bearing brick, includes all four exterior {{walls and the}} library carrel spaces immediately inside them. The <b>middle</b> <b>ring,</b> which is built of reinforced concrete, holds the heavy book stacks. The inner ring is a dramatic atrium with enormous circular openings in its walls that reveal several floors of book stacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} roads linking {{different parts}} of the city are mostly federal roads constructed and maintained by Malaysian Public Works Department. There are five major highways linking the Johor Bahru Central Business District to outlying suburbs: Tebrau Highway and Johor Bahru Eastern Dispersal Link Expressway in the northeast, Skudai Highway in the northwest, Iskandar Coastal Highway in the west and Johor Bahru East Coast Highway in the east. Pasir Gudang Highway and the connecting Johor Bahru Parkway cross Tebrau Highway and Skudai Highway, which serve as the <b>middle</b> <b>ring</b> road of the metropolitan area. The Johor Bahru Inner Ring Road, which connects with the Sultan Iskandar customs complex, aids in controlling the traffic in and around the central business district. Access to the national expressway is provided through the North–South Expressway and Senai–Desaru Expressway. The Johor–Singapore Causeway links the city to Woodlands, Singapore with a six-lane road and a railway line terminating at the Southern Integrated Gateway. Further expansion of other major highways in the city were currently in the process to improve the city road connection.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Kuala Lumpur Inner Ring Road (KLIRR) as the {{inner ring road}} in Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road 1 (KLMRR1), Kuala Lumpur Western/Northern Dispersal Link Scheme (Sprint Expressway and DUKE) and Kuala Lumpur <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road 2 (KLMRR2) also act as <b>middle</b> <b>ring</b> roads of the city. Kuala Lumpur–Kuala Selangor Expressway (KLS) (formerly Assam Jawa–Templer Park Highway (LATAR)), Kajang Dispersal Link Expressway (SILK), South Klang Valley Expressway (SKVE) and the planning Kuala Lumpur Outer Ring Road (KLORR) may form the outer ring roads of Kuala Lumpur.|$|E

25|$|Roads are {{the major}} arteries of Kuala Lumpur's {{transport}} network. The road network system in Kuala Lumpur {{is similar to the}} city road network system in major Chinese cites, where it has ring roads. The main ring roads in Kuala Lumpur are Kuala Lumpur Inner Ring Road, Kuala Lumpur <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road 1 and Kuala Lumpur <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road 2. Roads in Kuala Lumpur are usually 3 lanes in each direction, and certain roads such as Jalan Sultan Ismail and Jalan Bukit Bintang are one-way streets.|$|E

50|$|Pottery {{from the}} bottom of the ditches was also the type style for the Windmill Hill culture. Later {{occupation}} layers contained early Peterborough ware than the later Mortlake and Fengate varieties. Large quantities of bone, both human and animal, were also recovered from the ditch fill. The camp remained in use throughout the rest of the Neolithic with Grooved ware and Beaker potsherds having been found in later deposits. A Bronze Age bell barrow was later built between the inner and <b>middle</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R

25|$|Another {{development}} {{pioneered by}} the council was Sir Herbert Manzoni's Inner Ring Road and <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road. The Inner Ring Road split the Newhall Street through a road widening scheme at Great Charles Street. Whilst the Ring Road had no major effect on {{the core of the}} Jewellery Quarter, the immediate land adjacent to the Queensway was bought up by large businesses who constructed large office blocks alongside the road. The <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road bounded the Jewellery Quarter to the west and to the north and severely restricted the expansion of the Jewellery Quarter in the postwar years.|$|E
25|$|The Penang <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road, {{comprising}} Scotland Road, Green Lane and Jalan Tengku Kudin, is {{an important}} ring road within George Town, allowing vehicular traffic to bypass the busier roads within the city centre.|$|E
25|$|The Jewellery Quarter itself {{consists}} {{of a network of}} narrow streets. However, the area is bounded by large roads, chiefly a product of postwar redevelopment. To the south is Great Charles Street Queensway which formed part of the A4400 Inner Ring Road. Part of the road also {{consists of}} the Great Charles Street Queensway tunnel, part of the A38. To the northwest is Icknield Street which forms part of the A4540 <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road. At the western apex of the area, the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road forms a junction with the A457. At the northernmost point, Great Hampton Street crosses over the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road at Boulton Middleway. Great Hampton Street runs southeast and becomes Constitution Hill and then Old Snow Hill before merging with the Inner Ring Road at St Chad's Circus. To the southwest is Sand Pits and Summer Hill Road, forming part of the A457. Several bus services run through the Jewellery Quarter, and many National Express West Midlands buses run along the main roads on the boundaries.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} some {{exceptions}} in some highways. Some highways like Federal Highway (Federal Route 2) and Skudai Highway (Federal Route 1) retain their federal route codes. In addition, {{there are some}} highways in Malaysia which are classified as municipal roads such as Kuala Lumpur <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road 1.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the removal}} of the Inner Ring Road, which acted as a 'concrete collar' {{preventing}} expansion, the city centre is newly defined as being the area within the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ring</b> Road.

25|$|Since then, {{a number}} of other {{expressway}} projects within Penang, such as the Butterworth Outer Ring Road (BORR), the Butterworth–Seberang Jaya Toll Road and the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway were completed.
