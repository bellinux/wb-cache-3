The maximum avail-able gain is {{used to evaluate the}} quality of transformers similarly to that of active devices. The silicon substrate has a pronounced effect on the quality factor and mutual resistive coupling factor of the primary and secondary coils, thereby degrading the <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> <b>gain</b> of the transformer. A highly structured patterned ground shield is shown to improve the <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> <b>gain</b> of a transformer at high frequencies, while at low frequencies, it has little effect on the <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> <b>gain</b> and even degrades the quality factors of the transformer coils. It is shown that the low-fre-quency degradation of the coil quality factors relates to local eddy currents in the patterned metal shield.

In order to improve the performance of Si transistors enough to be competitive with III-V devices for RF and microwave application, while preserving the yield cost and manufacturing advantages associated with conventional Si fabrication, silicon-germanium(Si-Ge) hetero junction bipolar transistor has been introduced. SiGe HBTs can provide faster switching speeds than Si bipolar transistors mainly because of reduced base resistance and collector-to-substrate capacitance. Analyzing the small signal model of SiGe HBT, we computed its s parameters and plotted it in smith chart to a frequency variation of 1 - 18 GHz. Again we analyzed the circuit while taking the external parasitic effect into account and drew the S-parameters in a smith chart. So, in this frequency range we compared the performance of the device with and without taking the external substrate effect into account. We drew the graph for <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> power <b>gain</b> of common emitter SiGe HBT, with and without taking the substrate parasitic effect. We compared the graph in both the cases and verified that the <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> power <b>gain</b> decreases considerably due to the external substrate effect. We also verified the substrate effect in case of common base SiGe HBT and saw that, in this case also the <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> power <b>gain</b> decreases due to the external substrate effect. By plotting graph we verified that,if we don’t consider the substrate parasitic effects then the gain of SiGe HBT in CB mode is much higher than that of in CE mode. But inclusion of parasitic degrades the superior power gain of HBT in CB mode and hence its gain reduces than that of in CE mode Grounding the substrate is an effective way to reduce the effects of substrate parasitic on SiGe HBT used as an amplifier. We verified this, by plotting the graph of <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> power <b>gain</b> of common base and common emitter SiGe HBT while grounding the substrate and comparing it with while not grounding the substrate.

The high frequency performances of MOSFETs are generally characterized by the specific transit frequencies ft, fmax. ft and/or fmax, what is the good factor of merit to quantify {{the performance of a}} transistor ft, which corresponds to the transit frequency (when the gain is equal to 1) of the current gain, is an interesting criterion for high speed digital applications (speed and high swing) while fmax, which is defined as the transit frequency of the unilateral power gain is the best criterion for analogue microwave applications (amplifier, oscillators, etc.). fmax corresponds also to the transit frequency of the <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> power <b>gain</b> (MAG) that is a realistic parameter of the optimization of microwave amplifiers.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a {{low-cost}} method for the assembly of flexible substrate antennas and UHF RF identification silicon (Si) chips. Such a method exploits a magnetic coupling mechanism, thus not requiring for galvanic contacts between the Si chip and antenna itself. The magnetic coupling is established by a planar transformer, the primary and secondary windings of which are implemented on flexible substrate and Si chip, respectively. As a result, the Si chip can be assembled on the antenna with a mere placing and gluing process. First, the idea has been validated by theory. Electromagnetic simulations of a square heterogeneous transformer (1. 0 -mm side) show a <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> power <b>gain</b> (MAG) of 0. 4 dB at 868 MHz. In addition, the heterogeneous transformer is also quite tolerant with respect to misalignment between primary and secondary. An offset error of 150 m reduces the MAG to 0. 5 dB. A sub-optimal matching strategy, exploiting a simple on-chip capacitor, is then developed for antennas with 50 - input impedances. Finally, the idea has been experimentally validated exploiting printed circuit board (PCB) prototypes. A PCB transformer (1. 5 -mm side) and a transformer rectifier (two-diode Dickson multiplier) have been fabricated and tested.

40|$|Broad-band {{microwave}} {{integrated circuit}} (MIC) amplifier design is a complex, multi-disciplinary process. This work focuses on three important aspects: the behaviour of microstrip transmission lines, discontinuities, and related structures; the accurate measurement of components and devices mounted in microstrip circuits; and the circuit design methodology. Techniques for microstrip quasi-static analysis are reviewed {{in order to}} identify methods suitable for extension to deal with the effects of substrate anisotropy. An integral equation method is described and the anisotropic Green's function derived using an extension to the method of partial images. Proposed transform methods are assessed and the preferred option implemented by adaption of a microstrip analysis computer program. A method, by which accurate measurements of microstrip properties may be made, is developed. Involving measurements of the resonant behaviour of half-wavelength short circuit resonators with two arbitrary coupling conditions, this technique allows the unloaded properties to be deduced. Results for microstrip on a sapphire substrate concur with the analysis. A pragmatic but effective approach to the calculation of the capacity component of microstrip discontinuities, and some other three dimensional MIC structures, is described and developed to allow existing data for isotropic substrates to be applied to the anisotropic situation. The computer corrected network analyser (CCNA) is a widely used microwave measurement tool. Weaknesses in popular correction strategies are identified and remedies developed. In particular, revised calibration equations that better accommodate test port mismatch variation with s-parameter selection, and a model for quadrature error are presented. A 2 -port calibration scheme suitable for use with MIC transmission lines, using only simple standards, is described. The standards are partially self-calibrating;the values of propagation constant, loss, and end effect are deduced in the calibration process. An effective jig for use with microstrip is described and the results of measurements on microwave transistors presented. Conventionally microwave amplifiers are designed using reactive components both to achieve good port matches and compensate the frequency dependent gain of the active devices. The problems associated with this approach are enumerated and the alternatives reviewed. A methodology which combines the benefits of frequency dependant dissipative networks with the elegance of reactive network synthesis is described. The device gain slope is compensated by simple lumped or distributed circuits incorporating a resistive element to produce a composite `device' with a specififed (flat) <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> <b>gain</b> frequency response. Reactive matching networks are then used to interface these gain blocks. By this structured approach the amplifier gain breakdown can be defined at the outset and preserved through the design process. Other advantages stemming from the use of dissipative compensation include improved tolerance to device parameter and component value scatter, reduced group delay variations and enhanced reverse isolation. The method is demonstrated by the design and characterisation of 4 to 9 GHz amplifier having a representative specification. The close conformance of the performance of the untrimmed amplifier to that predicted by computer simulation testifies to the inherent accuracy of the design method, the microstrip (and related structures) analysis techniques and the CCNA MIC calibration scheme...|$|E
