2500|$|President Bush, 45 {{days after}} 9/11, Congress passed the Patriot Act, which takes away checks on law enforcement, weakens American citizens' rights and freedoms, {{especially}} Fourth Amendment rights. With expansions of the Patriot Act and Patriot Act II, <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>is,</b> why are my rights being watered down and my citizens around me, {{and what are}} the specific justifications for these reforms? ...|$|E
40|$|One day I {{received}} {{electronic mail}} from our director of campus security [Gilbraith 1993]: 2 ̆ 2 I have a puzzle {{for you that}} has practical applications for me. I {{need to know how}} many different combinations there are for our combination locks. A lock has 5 buttons. In setting the combination you can use only 1 button or as many as 5. Buttons may be pressed simultaneously and / or successively, but the same button cannot be used more than once in the same combination. I had a student (obviously not a math major) email me that there are only 120 possibilities, but even I know this is only if you press all five buttons one at a time. It doesn 2 ̆ 7 t take into account 1 - 23 - 4 - 5, for instance. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> how many combinations exist, and is it enough to keep our buildings adequately protected? 2 ̆ 2 To clarify, combinations like 1 - 25 - 4 (which is the same as 1 - 52 - 4 but different from 4 - 25 - 1) and 1 - 2 - 5 - 43 are legal, whereas 13 - 35 is illegal because the number 3 is used twice. I gave this problem to the students in my discrete mathematics class as a bonus exercise. Most arrived at the (correct) answer of 1081 or 1082 by breaking the problem into oodles of cases, but this would not have been a convenient method if the locks contained 10 buttons instead of 5. I use this problem as an excuse to demonstrate the power of generating functions by solving the n-button problem. Most students are amazed that the problem is essentially solved by the function ex /(2 - ex), which leads to a surprisingly accurate approximation of n!/(ln 2) n+ 1...|$|E

He swears {{to me he}} is, but {{meanwhile}} does nothing--except of course that he's so kind to me--to prove it; and couldn't really act much otherwise if he weren't. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> just now was exactly on this queer impression of his diplomacy: as if instead of really giving ground his line were to keep me on here and set me a bad example." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hi. My name is Sam Garcia. I'm from Colorado Springs, Colorado. The {{following}} {{question is for}} Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani, a while back, a friend and I were having a discussion about you {{and some of the}} other Republican candidates. He blatantly made this statement somewhere along the line: Rudy Giuliani is using September 11, 2001, to propel himself into the White House. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> is: How do <b>you</b> respond <b>to</b> this accusation and other accusations similar to it? ...|$|R
5000|$|Good evening, candidates. This is Seekster from Arlington, Texas, {{and this}} {{question}} is for Ron Paul. I've {{met a lot of}} your supporters online, but I've noticed that a good number of them seem to buy into this conspiracy theory regarding the Council of Foreign Relations, and some plan to make a North American union by merging the United States with Canada and Mexico. These supporters of yours seem <b>to</b> think that <b>you</b> also believe in this theory. So <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> is: Do you really believe in all this, or are people just putting words in your mouth? ...|$|R

Your father and several others {{of us have been}} allies for some time in some very important matters connected with finance. For the last few months, however, we have all felt a sort of vague uneasiness one with the other. Apparently we were all still pulling the same way, yet I think that each one of us had the feeling that there was something wrong. We all began to distrust one another. To come to an end quickly, I hope I do not offend you, Miss Duge, when I say that it is my belief that your father has been and is trying to deceive us for his own benefit." ...|$|R
60|$|NAPOLEON. Psha! madam: it is {{the only}} thing that matters: the value of human life is the value of the {{greatest}} living man. Cut off that infinitesimal layer of grey matter which distinguishes my brain from that of the common man, and you cut down the stature of humanity from that of a giant to that of a nobody. I matter supremely: my soldiers do not matter at all: there are plenty more where they came from. If you kill me, or put a stop to my activity ({{it is the}} same thing), the nobler part of human life perishes. You must save the world from that catastrophe, madam. War has made me popular, powerful, famous, historically immortal. But I foresee that if I go on to the end it will leave me execrated, dethroned, imprisoned, perhaps executed. Yet if I stop fighting I commit suicide as a great man and become a common one. How am I to escape the horns of this tragic dilemma? Victory I can guarantee: I am invincible. But the cost of victory is the demoralization, the depopulation, the ruin of the victors no less than of the vanquished. How am I to satisfy my genius by fighting until I die? that is <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R

6000|$|He indulgently {{shook my}} hand again, and I felt <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> be crude and my distinctions pitiful. [...] "Good-night, my dear boy--don't bother about it. After all, you do like a fellow." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{front of}} a {{glittering}} hotel a friend of mine, a critic, was climbing from a cab. He seemed at leisure; and I put <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> him. He answered me conscientiously, as I was sure he would.|$|R
6000|$|He {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} and then repeated <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the Mahar spokesman. When the latter had explained in the strange sign-language that passes for speech between the Mahars and their fighting men the Sagoth turned again to me: ...|$|R
