The idea has been supported by Lynn Margulis who extended her endosymbiotic theory which suggests that cell organelles originated from free living organisms to the idea that individual organisms of many species could be considered as symbionts within a larger metaphorical [...] "super-organism".|$|E

40|$|Decomposing {{cultures}} of <b>macro-organisms</b> in sea water, with no added mineral media, produced faithful enrichments of phototrophic sulphur bacteria. The enrichments brought about spectacular colouration {{of the sea}} water solutions and specific bacterial progression, {{depending on the type}} of decomposing biomass. These patterns were remarkably consistent in enrichments from geographically isolated marine locations on the east coast of India. Chemical analysis of sea water in decomposition experiments with or without lighting indicated incomplete sulphide oxidation by the phototrophs, yielding primarily elemental sulphur. Contrary to the presumption that marine sponges are the only exceptional aerobic habitat for phototrophic sulphur bacteria, the present results strongly suggest that these anaerobic bacteria may generally subsist in association with <b>macro-organisms</b> and are prevalent in coastal waters...|$|R
50|$|Microbial biogeographic {{patterns}} are often {{similar to those}} of macro-organisms. Microbes generally follow well-known patterns such as the distance decay relationship, the abundance-range relationship, and Rapoport's rule. This is surprising given the many disparities between microorganisms and macro-organisms, in particular their size (micrometers vs. meters), time between generations (minutes vs. years), and dispersibility (global vs. local). However, important differences between the biogeographical patterns of microorganism and <b>macro-organism</b> do exist, and likely result from differences in their underlying biogeographic processes (e.g., drift, dispersal, selection, and mutation). For example, dispersal is an important biogeographical process for both microbes and larger organisms, but small microbes can disperse across much greater ranges and at much greater speeds by traveling through the atmosphere (for larger animals dispersal is much more constrained due to their size). As a result, many microbial species can be found in both northern and southern hemispheres, while larger animals are typically found only at one pole rather than both.|$|E
5000|$|Ecology is a {{new science}} and {{considered}} as an important branch of biological science, having only become prominent {{during the second half}} of the 20th century. Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy, particularly from ethics and politics. [...] Its history stems all the way back to the 4th century. One of the first ecologists whose writings survive may have been Aristotle or perhaps his student, Theophrastus, both of whom had interest in many species of animals and plants. Theophrastus described interrelationships between animals and their environment as early as the 4th century BC. Ecology developed substantially in the 18th and 19th century. It began with Carl Linnaeus and his work with the economy of nature. Soon after came Alexander von Humboldt and his work with botanical geography. Alfred Russel Wallace and Karl Möbius then contributed with the notion of biocoenosis. Eugenius Warming’s work with ecological plant geography led to the founding of ecology as a discipline. Charles Darwin’s work also contributed to the science of ecology, and Darwin is often attributed with progressing the discipline more than anyone else in its young history. Ecological thought expanded even more in the early 20th century. Major contributions included: Eduard Suess’ and Vladimir Vernadsky’s work with the biosphere, Arthur Tansley’s ecosystem, Charles Elton's Animal Ecology, and Henry Cowles ecological succession. Ecology influenced the social sciences and humanities. Human ecology began in the early 20th century and it recognized humans as an ecological factor. Later James Lovelock advanced views on earth as a <b>macro-organism</b> with the Gaia hypothesis. Conservation stemmed from the science of ecology. Important figures and movements include Shelford and the ESA, National Environmental Policy act, George Perkins Marsh, Theodore Roosevelt, Stephen A. Forbes, and post-Dust Bowl conservation. Later in the 20th century world governments collaborated on man’s effects on the biosphere and Earth’s environment.|$|E

40|$|The Ediacaran Period, {{stretching}} from 635 – 542 million years ago, {{is one of}} the most dynamic intervals in the history of life. It witnessed the rapid transition from a microbially-dominated world, which had existed undisturbed for almost three billion years, to a Phanerozoic biosphere that is greatly modified by the interactions between <b>macro-organisms</b> and Earth surface systems. Ediacaran successions worldwide contain enigmatic assemblages of fossilised soft-bodied organisms. Determining the biological affinities of these fossils represents one of the major challenges in modern palaeontology. This thesis addresses some of the fundamental questions surrounding the Ediacara biota of the Avalon region from taphonomic, ontogenetic and palaeoenvironmental perspectives. Up-to-date stratigraphic ranges are produced for Avalonian <b>macro-organisms,</b> documenting spatial and temporal trends in their occurrence. New fossil assemblages are described, which include populations of juvenile rangeomorphs, and one of the earliest examples of community succession in the fossil record. The previously unexplained fossil Ivesheadia Boynton and Ford 1996 is re-described as a taphomorph, preserving the remains of Ediacaran <b>macro-organisms</b> that had died and undergone microbial decay on the seafloor prior to burial. This hypothesis implies considerable time-averaging of Avalonian palaeocommunities, and consequently suggests that the preserved fossil assemblages do not represent census populations of living organisms at the time of burial. Microbial decay is experimentally demonstrated to replicate aspects of Ivesheadia-type morphology, supporting the arguments presented herein for the preservation of microbially-induced taphomorphs during the Ediacaran. Finally, the discovery of the oldest evidence for metazoan locomotion, from 565 Ma horizons at Mistaken Point in Newfoundland, suggests that motile <b>macro-organisms</b> were present amongst the Ediacara biota, ~ 20 Myrs before the Cambrian boundary. This portrayal of Ediacaran palaeobiology views the deep-marine Avalonian ecosystems as diverse assemblages of both macro- and micro-organisms. Such palaeoenvironments preserve rare evidence of organisms capable of locomotion, and are likely to have included metazoans. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{elevated}} levels of antibodies against various antigens of Group A pyogenic streptococci are found in rheumatic fever (Harris, 1948; Rantz and others, 1951). This phenomenon {{may be due to the}} increased immunologic reactivity of the <b>macro-organism,</b> to repeated natural infection by the micro-organism, or to the persistence of the micro-organism in the body of the host longer than in normal individuals. Several authors have already tried to establish that rheumatic subjects develop more antibodies than normal persons, even to antigens other than streptococcal. Creger, Choy, and Rantz (1951) found that patients with diseases in which immunologic patho-genesis is presumed produce antibodies in higher titres than controls, but their tests have the dis-advantage of small numbers. Miller, Kibrick, and Massell (1953) found in rheumatic subjects only a slight elevation of titres after immunization in comparison with controls.

Substantial heterogeneity was observed for both analytes in all probes, especially in the vicinity of seagrass roots and particulate organic matter. Measured distributions tended to follow the general patterns predicted by the tertiary electron acceptor layering model. However, there was unexpected overlap of sulfide and iron(II) distributions at the millimetre to centimetre scale in several samples from different sediments, notably the more complex sediments containing particulate organic matter and seagrass roots. The cause of such overlap is unclear and further study is necessary to elucidate how such distributions can occur. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|As {{coral reef}} {{habitats}} decline worldwide, some reefs are transitioning from coral- to algal-dominated benthos with the exact cause for this shift remaining elusive. Increases in {{the abundance of}} microbes {{in the water column}} has been correlated with an increase in coral disease and reduction in coral cover. Here we investigated how multiple reef organisms influence microbial communities in the surrounding water column. Our study consisted of a field assessment of microbial communities above replicate patches dominated by a single <b>macro-organism.</b> Metagenomes were constructed from 20 L of water above distinct macro-organisms, including (1) the coral Mussismilia braziliensis, (2) fleshy macroalgae (Stypopodium, Dictota and Canistrocarpus), (3) turf algae, and (4) the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum and were compared to the water microbes collected 3 m above the reef. Microbial genera and functional potential were annotated using MG-RAST and showed that the dominant benthic macro-organisms influence the taxa and functions of microbes in the water column surrounding them, developing a specific “aura-biome”. The coral aura-biome reflected the open water column, and was associated with Synechococcus and functions suggesting oligotrophic growth, while the fleshy macroalgae aura-biome was associated with Ruegeria, Pseudomonas, and microbial functions suggesting low oxygen conditions. The turf algae aura-biome was associated with Vibrio, Flavobacterium, and functions suggesting pathogenic activity, while zoanthids were associated with Alteromonas and functions suggesting a stressful environment. Because each benthic organism has a distinct aura-biome, a change in benthic cover will change the microbial community of the water, which may lead to either the stimulation or suppression of the recruitment of benthic organisms...|$|E

Methods Taxon-specific sequence abundance and location were retrieved from the open-access V 6 -rRNA pyrotag sequence data base VAMPS ([URL] which holds a massive collection of marine bacterial community data sets from the International Census of Marine Microbes sampling effort of global ocean water masses. Data were randomly subsampled to correct for spatial bias and {{for differences in}} sampling effort. Results We show that bacterial latitudinal ranges are narrower than expected by chance. When present in both Northern and Southern hemispheres, taxa occupy restricted ranges at similar latitudes {{on both sides of}} the equator. A significant and positive relationship exists between sequence abundance and latitudinal range, although this pattern contains a large amount of variance. Abundant taxa in the tropics and in the Northern Hemisphere generally have smaller ranges than those in the Southern Hemisphere.
