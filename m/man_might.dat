5|$|At {{the time}} Kanō stood 1.57 m (5feet 2inches) but weighed only 41kg (90pounds). He wished he were stronger. One day, Nakai Baisei (a {{friend of the}} family {{who was a member of}} the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu was an excellent form of physical training. He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller <b>man</b> <b>might</b> overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous. Kanō's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu, telling him to pursue a modern sport instead.|$|E
5|$|Courtly {{love was}} the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, {{it could also be}} private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu {{were laid out}} 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to {{be put in a}} cart... to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every <b>man</b> <b>might</b> see them; and so they lay for three or four days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E

60|$|This {{appealed to}} the crowd--the last {{statements}} of the doomed <b>men</b> <b>might</b> add another thrill to the evening's entertainment.|$|R
25|$|Others {{may choose}} to take a mixed approach, {{adopting}} some feminine traits and some masculine traits in their appearance. For instance, a <b>man</b> <b>might</b> wear both a dress and a beard. This is sometimes known as genderfuck.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to standard holy days, most Christians observe many saints' days. A <b>man</b> <b>might</b> give a small feast {{on his personal}} saint's day. The local voluntary association (called the maheber) connected with each church honors its patron saint with a special service and a feast {{two or three times}} a year.|$|E
25|$|Based on the teeth, {{forensic}} odontologist Gunnar Johansson {{has concluded}} {{that the man was}} between 25 and 35 years old when he died. Osteologist Nils-Gustaf Gevall has, based on the skeleton, come up with an age of between 35 and 40 years, though the <b>man</b> <b>might</b> have been up to 60 years old.|$|E
60|$|Once out of Black Michael's sight {{any of the}} <b>men</b> <b>might</b> strike them down, {{and still}} leave Black Michael's {{conscience}} clear.|$|R
60|$|Some <b>men</b> <b>might</b> {{have still}} {{resisted}} her; but Amelius {{was not one}} of them. He took her hand, and pressed it tenderly.|$|R
60|$|Half a dozen <b>men</b> <b>might</b> {{have walked}} around the encampment without being {{observed}} by the boys, and Bill's delay seemed very singular.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the idea}} {{does not appear}} quite {{definitely}} expressed in Darwin's discussion {{of the development of}} mental powers, it seems quite clear that his main object has been to express his conviction that the mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection. This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of <b>man</b> <b>might</b> very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning.|$|E
25|$|The find is {{generally}} dated to the 14th century. The dating {{is based on}} the clothing, especially the type of hood he wore. Albert Sandklef specified the date of the find to the 1360s, while Margareta Nockert suggests the 1330s. Owe Wennerholm argues that the hood he wore was used over a much larger time frame and only limits the date of the find to between 1250 and 1520. He does however put forward the hypothesis that the <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be Simon Gudmundi, a 15th-century priest, known to have died in 1491.|$|E
25|$|Socrates gets Hippias {{to agree}} that the more a man knows about a subject, the better {{position}} he will be in to lie about it. He argues that the man who knows the subjects about which he tells lies, whether arithmetic, geometry, or astronomy, is twice as powerful as the man who does not know his subjects. Socrates never indicates what a <b>man</b> <b>might</b> stand to gain from lying about such matters, but brings the conversation back around to Achilles, and what kind of man Homer intended to portray.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Mohanlal {{was cast}} in the lead {{antagonist}} role in Manjil Virinja Pookkal – the directorial debut of Fazil. The film became a major success. Mohanlal's friends had sent his application {{in response to an}} advertisement released by Navodaya Studio. He auditioned for the role in front of a panel that included professional directors. Displeased with his appearance, two of them gave him poor marks but Fazil and Jijo Appachan gave him 90 and 95 marks out of 100. In an interview with Reader's Digest in 2004, Mohanlal said that his looks as a young <b>man</b> <b>might</b> have fit the villain's image.|$|E
25|$|The {{married couple}} formed a single unit {{in terms of}} {{external}} responsibility, especially for debt. The man was responsible for debts contracted by his wife, even before her marriage, {{as well as for}} his own; but he could use her as a mancipium (see above). Hence the Code allowed a proviso to be inserted in the marriage contract, that the wife should not be seized for her husband's pre-nuptial debts; but stipulated that then he was not responsible for her pre-nuptial debts, and, in any case, that both together were responsible for all debts contracted after marriage. A <b>man</b> <b>might</b> make his wife a settlement by deed of gift, which gave her a life interest in part of his property, and he might reserve to her the right to bequeath it to a favorite child; but she could in no case leave it to her family. Although married, she always remained a member of her father's house—she is rarely named wife of A, but usually daughter of B, or mother of C.|$|E
500|$|Raised in a {{religious}} environment, Charles Darwin studied to be an Anglican clergyman. While eventually doubting parts of his faith, Darwin continued to help in church affairs, even while avoiding church attendance. Darwin stated {{that it would be}} [...] "absurd to doubt that a <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be an ardent theist and an evolutionist". Although reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that [...] "I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. – I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Content," [...] replied Halbert Glendinning: [...] "I {{will guide}} thee {{to a spot}} where an hundred <b>men</b> <b>might</b> fight and fall without any chance of interruption." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But his <b>men</b> <b>might</b> break loose, {{away from}} his sight. Especially thet Dick Sears. He's a bad man. So be watchful {{whenever}} you ride out." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{the fight}} was ended, and from its {{beginning}} till the finish was not longer than the time in which <b>men</b> <b>might</b> count a hundred slowly.|$|R
500|$|Darwin {{remained}} {{close friends}} with the vicar of Downe, John Brodie Innes, and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church, but from around 1849 would {{go for a walk}} on Sundays while his family attended church. He considered it [...] "absurd to doubt that a <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be an ardent theist and an evolutionist" [...] and, though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that [...] "I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God.– I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind".|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{praise from}} critics with The Moving Picture World stating, [...] " [...] picture which touches {{the heart and}} arouses the strongest emotions. It can be readily understood how a <b>man</b> <b>might</b> become a maniac under such circumstances. The loss of a wife and daughter is sufficient to overthrow reason. That a man should be a hermit afterward seems not unusual. Then comes {{the excitement of the}} runaway, the rescue of the baby and the discovery of his daughter, with returning reason and love to follow during his declining years. The emotions will be strongly aroused by this picture, and that will make it popular. Whatever touches the heart is always popular, and this seems to appeal with unusual power." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror offered minor praise for the film for the production and its acting.|$|E
500|$|Early stories {{featured}} him targeting {{children or}} young adults. Some featured young adults driven insane or {{to act on}} his behalf, while others did not, and others claim that investigating the Slender Man will draw his attention. The web series Marble Hornets established the idea of proxies (humans who fall under the Slender Man's influence) though initially they were simply violently insane, rather than puppets of the Slender Man. Marble Hornets also introduced {{the idea that the}} Slender Man could interfere with video and audio recordings, as well as the [...] "Slender Man symbol", which became a common trope of Slender fiction. Graphic violence and body horror are uncommon in the Slender Man mythos, with many narratives choosing to leave the fate of his victims obscure. Shira Chess notes that [...] "It {{is important to note that}} few of the retellings identify exactly what kind of monster the Slender <b>Man</b> <b>might</b> be, and what his specific intentions are- these points all remain mysteriously and usefully vague." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{well that}} the rule does not hold off the stage, or good <b>men</b> <b>might</b> be misjudged. We ourselves, for instance, wear a clean collar--sometimes.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{during the}} Han, {{ordinary}} commoners had no regular military service obligation, though {{in rare cases}} of urgent need <b>men</b> <b>might</b> still be conscripted for temporary duty.|$|R

500|$|The {{harm done}} by Formosa lies in this,— that the {{character}} is utterly false, false to human nature and false to London life. She is a wretch, abominable almost beyond conception, {{so as to be}} odious, if known, to the most odious. She is sharper as well as prostitute,—and is false to all with whom she comes in contact, to those whom she is supposed to love and to those who love her. Her peculiar profession is represented as causing her no personal remorse. And yet she is exhibited to us as a fine creature, a noble woman, one whom a <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be honoured by loving;—and at last she ends with a success! ... That which is vile and dirty, squalid and miserable,—that, of which we may say that were its horrors known such knowledge would deter more thoroughly than any ignorance,—is exhibited as a bright existence, full of danger indeed, but still open to all that is noble, and capable of final success.|$|E
500|$|Others, like Harold Bloom, have {{emphasized}} the [...] "exhausted landscape", the completion, the finality of death, although [...] "Winter descends here as a <b>man</b> <b>might</b> hope to die, with a natural sweetness". If death in itself is final, here {{it comes with a}} lightness, a softness, also pointing to [...] "an acceptance of process beyond the possibility of grief." [...] The progress of growth is no longer necessary; maturation is complete, and life and death are in harmony. The rich description of the cycle of the seasons enables the reader to feel a belonging [...] "to something larger than the self", as James O'Rourke expresses it, but the cycle comes to an end each year, analogous to the ending of single life. O'Rourke suggests that something of a fear of that ending is subtly implied {{at the end of the}} poem, although, unlike the other great odes, in this poem the person of the poet is entirely submerged, so there is at most a faint hint of Keats's own possible fear.|$|E
500|$|The Act was not {{effectively}} enforced, and did {{not address}} the working conditions of 'free children' (children working in mills who were not apprentices) who rapidly came to heavily outnumber the apprentices. [...] Regulating the way masters treated their apprentices was a recognised responsibility of Parliament and hence the Act itself was non-contentious, but coming between employer and employee to specify on what terms a <b>man</b> <b>might</b> sell his labour (or that of his child) was highly contentious. [...] Hence it was not until 1819 that an Act to limit the hours of work (and set a minimum age) for 'free children' working in cotton mills was piloted through Parliament by Peel and his son Robert (the future Prime Minister). [...] Strictly speaking, it is Peel's Cotton Mills and Factories Act of 1819 which (although also ineffective for want of a means of proper enforcement) paved the way for subsequent Factory Acts that would regulate the industry and set up effective means of regulation; but it is Peel's Act of 1802 which first recognised by legislation the evils of child labour in cotton mills that the Factory Acts addressed.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was as if}} Colonel Easton {{believed}} some of his <b>men</b> <b>might</b> {{take advantage}} of the opportunity, and stepping quickly to the side of Allen, he said: ...|$|R
