5|$|An {{attempt was}} made to provide the {{completed}} Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. The NRC refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, the NRC could <b>make</b> <b>no</b> use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation.

5|$|Burnett {{took his}} seat in the 37th Congress; sources <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mention of his making good on his threat {{not to take the}} oath of office. Just days after the First Battle of Bull Run, Burnett's fellow Kentuckian, John J. Crittenden {{proposed}} a resolution blaming the war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states. Burnett asked that the question be divided. His request was granted, but he only found one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war.|$|E
5|$|By 1972 FANK was decimated, {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was rampant. The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million tons in 1969 to 493,000 tons in 1973. Popular {{support for the war}} against the North Vietnamese and the insurgents had completely evaporated. The Americans, negotiating with the North Vietnamese, had proposed an Indochina-wide cease fire as part of the final settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam.

5|$|Henry had Anne {{investigated}} for high treason in April 1536. On 2 May {{she was arrested}} {{and sent to the}} Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers – which included Henry Percy, her former betrothed, and her own uncle, Thomas Howard – and found guilty on 15 May. She was beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mention of this charge.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen {{offered a}} {{different}} approach. Answering criticisms {{that there was}} no mention of this incident in any of the many non-Christian sources, he insisted that it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside. To suggestions it was merely an eclipse, Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark, which <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mention of the sun.|$|E
5|$|Rudimentary organs such as {{the human}} tailbone, now much reduced from their {{functional}} state, are readily understood as signs of evolution, the explanation being that they were cut down by natural selection from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but <b>make</b> <b>no</b> sense at all if species {{are considered to be}} fixed. The tailbone is homologous to the tails of other primates.|$|E
50|$|Another {{difficulty}} with {{this model of}} electricity is that it ignores the interactions between electricity and magnetism.

5|$|Sources <b>make</b> <b>no</b> {{mention of}} why Pope Gregory chose a monk {{to head the}} mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine's {{knowledge}} of the Bible, so Augustine was evidently well educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews {{as well as being}} pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.|$|E

In addition, Wizards of the Coast created a miniature for the character, along with other characters in the Knights of the Old Republic series, which was released August 19, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{relied on}} the {{provision}} of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration.

Johnson's counsel insisted that he <b>make</b> <b>no</b> appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.|$|E

5|$|The last non-royal member {{appointed}} to the order was James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn in 1922, {{who served as the}} first Governor of Northern Ireland. When the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom that same year, the Irish Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave chose to <b>make</b> <b>no</b> further appointments to the Order. The British government continued to entertain hopes for the order's revival as a pan-Irish institution. Therefore, while there was no legal or constitutional bar to the British government continuing to make appointments from among British subjects resident in Northern Ireland, it chose not to do so.|$|E
5|$|The related {{question}} of whether the opera contains a specifically anti-Semitic message is also debated. Some of Wagner's contemporaries and commentators (e.g. Hans von Wolzogen and Ernest Newman) who analysed Parsifal at length, <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mention of any anti-Semitic interpretations. However the critics Paul Lindau and Max Nordbeck, present at Parsifal 's premiere, noted in their reviews how the work accorded with Wagner's anti-Jewish sentiments. More recent commentators continue to highlight the perceived anti-Semitic nature of the opera, and find correspondences with anti-Semitic passages found in Wagner's writings and articles of the period.|$|E
