40|$|We {{want to know}} what’s {{going on}} {{in the minds of the}} Georgia Tech community: What are the students, professors, and alumni talking about and how have these {{thoughts}} changed over time? We intend to peer into the collective of Georgia Tech by analyzing anonymous comments for conversation threads and persistent topics. The planned data sources are “Slivers”, anonymous comments submitted to and published weekly in the Georgia Tech school newspaper, the Technique. Slivers are an excellent source of opinion data: • They are anonymous, so users can offer candid criticism without fear of repercussion. • They require negligible preparation for submission, comments can be spontaneous and barrier of entry is low. • They are free and readily available. On the other hand, while they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> profanity and ‘unprintable statements’, Slivers are not spell-checked or <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> grammar which might make text comparison more difficult.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The design {{engineers}} for harbor structures normally learned the trades from their company or self-educated {{at the beginning}} of their career. Due to this unsystematic education approach, each design company has its own design format and accumulated design databases. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a design program for personnel com-puter usage that enables young engineers to learn about designing of harbor structures such as caisson type of breakwaters. This program uses a unified design format written in MS Visual Basic for the user interface and the MS Excel for the actual design calculation. This program contains well developed GUI including drawings and input values as well as immediate display of calculated values. Moreover, the input values are saved as a text file so that it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> various design conditions and process. Ultimately, this program allows optimization of the total costs among various design conditions. The program will greatly help beginning engineers to understand about the optimum design and overall design procedure...|$|R
50|$|A fix-up (or fixup) {{is a novel}} {{created from}} several short fiction stories that may or <b>may</b> not have <b>been</b> {{initially}} related or previously published. The stories <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> consistency, and sometimes new connecting material, such as a frame story or other interstitial narration, is written for the new work. The term was coined by the science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt, who published several fix-ups of his own, including The Voyage of the Space Beagle, but the concept (if not the term) exists outside of science fiction. The {{use of the term}} in science fiction criticism was popularised by the first (1979) edition of the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, edited by Peter Nicholls, which credited Van Vogt with the creation of the term.The name comes from the modifications that the author needs to make in the original texts to make them fit together as though they were a novel. Foreshadowing of events from the later stories <b>may</b> <b>be</b> jammed into an early chapter of the fix-up, and character development <b>may</b> <b>be</b> interleaved throughout the book. Contradictions and inconsistencies between episodes are usually worked out.|$|R

5000|$|Movies {{comprise}} much of {{the programming}} content seen on most pay television services, particularly those with a general entertainment format and those that focus exclusively on films; films that are broadcast on most premium channels air in their original theatrically-released (and in some cases, unrated home video or DVD) versions; this is in comparison to films aired on terrestrial television or basic cable, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> subject to <b>edits</b> <b>for</b> time and/or content, depending on what content a jurisdiction allows to be shown over-the-air or on basic cable. Many pay television services obtain rights to films through exclusive agreements with film distributors (this did not become the norm in the U.S. until the mid-1980s, {{as it would be}} common for the same film to be broadcast on unrelated pay services during its term of license); films acquired during the original term of license agreements with a distributor <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> broadcast as [...] "sub-runs," [...] in which a service holds rights to film long after the conclusion of a distribution agreement (under this arrangement, the pay service that originally licensed the rights to a particular film title, or one other than that which had held rights, may hold the broadcast rights through a library content deal).|$|R
5|$|Eusebius' {{first version}} of the Chronicon was written in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, {{translation}} and continuation dates to 380. The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that {{the substance of the}} original survives. Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the Chronicon only covers the period from 325 to 378—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only implied in the entry on Decius' persecution. Jerome's Chronicon is, therefore, the nearest we can get to Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip primus in the Chronicon thus admits of two interpretations: either he found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him. Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a strong case for Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible. Shahîd believes that primus appeared in Eusebius {{first version of}} the Chronicon, but <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>edited</b> out <b>for</b> the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.|$|R
5000|$|Harrison is {{probably}} {{best known for his}} long association with Billy Wilder. As a new immigrant to the United States in the 1930s, Wilder had found work as a screenwriter for Paramount, where Harrison was also working as an editor. Wilder and Harrison both worked on Midnight in 1939, and again on Hold Back the Dawn in 1941. By 1942 Wilder had persuaded the management at Paramount to assign him {{as the director of the}} comedy The Major and the Minor; Wilder had previously directed just a single film in France. Wilder asked that Harrison be assigned as the film's editor. Wilder has been quoted as saying about this early assignment, [...] "I worked with a very good cutter, Doane Harrison, from whom I learned a great deal. He was much more of a help to me than the cameraman. When I became a director from a writer my technical knowledge was very meagre." [...] Sam Stagg has described their early collaboration, [...] "In valuable early lessons, Harrison taught Wilder how to preplan each shot as part of a total editing scheme. The results: Time and money saved, and few protection shots required. (The term [...] "protection shot", also called coverage, refers to footage shot from various setups and angles that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> needed <b>for</b> <b>editing</b> a sequence in the cutting room.)" ...|$|R
40|$|De Wet Reitz {{requires}} {{a model to}} simulate the amount of property conveyance tasks that will be generated at ideal conditions, from the joint venture of a real estate company. The amount of conveyance tasks are determined by a “series” predetermined by De Wet Reitz. These conveyance tasks will generate income; thus resources {{will be needed to}} process the conveyance tasks because at present the resources are not optimal and also not sufficient. The simulation of the amount of tasks will be performed by a Monte Carlo simulation that will also display different scenarios. The inputs of the Monte Carlo simulation will be able to be changed as to generate different scenarios. This joint venture project requires investment from other capital sources; therefore a need exists for a model to estimate the break-even point and the capital needed before the break-even point is achieved. In addition {{there is a need for}} the optimal amount of resources to optimise the workload and maximise the income relative to the cost. This can be accomplished through a cash flow projection method and calculations completed from the projections. The projections is also required by De Wet Reitz. The model will be built in Java. Java is able to accommodate these simulation needs together with the solutions, for building the simulation model. The model is completed in Java and will accommodate the average income per branch from De Wet Reitz. The model will simulate, optimise and visualise the cash flow of De Wet Reitz and through this method De Wet Reitz will be able to determine whether the scenarios are feasible. The result of the simulation will be measured against De Wet Reitz expectations, if the models’ output shows less than expected management will be able to change inputs and scenarios until the desired effect is achieved, for verification, and what factors should be changed and managed to achieve the desired result. This model <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> future implementation into other De Wet Reitz projects. The model will ultimately simulate the profit and display it as a projection. De Wet Reitz will then be able to identify the number of resources that should be allocated at a specific time, the amount of capital needed for the project and if the project is feasible within a 60 month period.
