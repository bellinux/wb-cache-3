2500|$|A {{practical}} advantage, one DSSCs {{share with}} most thin-film technologies, {{is that the}} cell's <b>mechanical</b> <b>robustness</b> indirectly leads to higher efficiencies in higher temperatures. In any semiconductor, increasing temperature will promote some electrons into the conduction band [...] "mechanically". The fragility of traditional silicon cells requires them {{to be protected from}} the elements, typically by encasing them in a glass box similar to a greenhouse, with a metal backing for strength. Such systems suffer noticeable decreases in efficiency as the cells heat up internally. DSSCs are normally built with only a thin layer of conductive plastic on the front layer, allowing them to radiate away heat much easier, and therefore operate at lower internal temperatures.|$|E

50|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>robustness</b> {{compared}} to alumina {{is attributed to}} the displacive phase transformation of the metastable tetragonal ziroconia grains when the material is stressed. The stress concentration at a crack tip can cause a transformation from a tetragonal crystal structure to a monoclinic one, which has an associated volume expansion of ziroconia. This volume expansion effectively pushes back the propagation of the crack and results in higher toughness and strength.|$|E

50|$|The Australian-built Capri was {{intended}} primarily for export to the US. Exports began in 1991, as the Mercury Capri. When {{the car was}} new, it had a poor reputation for reliability, although many still exist today perhaps due to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>robustness</b> of the Laser/323 upon which it was based. In particular, the Capri's roof was prone to leaking, due to poor-quality materials being used; although Ford quickly resolved the issue, the car's poor reputation stuck. As a result, the MX-5 was comfortably more popular, particularly as that car was rear-wheel-drive, and enthusiasts were skeptical about the front-wheel-drive arrangement that the Capri used.|$|E

In order to achieve sufficient ion conduction, an SOFC with a YSZ electrolyte must be operated at high temperatures (800 °C-1000 °C). While it is advantageous that YSZ retains <b>mechanical</b> <b>robustness</b> at those temperatures, the high temperature necessary is often a disadvantage of SOFCs. The high density of YSZ is also necessary in order to physically separate the gaseous fuel from oxygen, or else the electrochemical system would produce no electrical power.|$|E

40|$|Background Fermentation using {{encapsulated}} yeast {{leads to}} more robust ethanol production from lignocellulose hydrolyzates. Encapsulated yeast is much more tolerant to inhibitors present in hydrolyzates, and fermentation is faster due to increased total cell density. For industrial applications, capsules must be made robust enough to endure long periods and numerous cultivations without breaking. Results Liquid core alginatechitosanalginate (ACA) capsules containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae were produced by the liquid-droplet-forming method and treated with hydrolyzed 3 -aminopropyltrietoxysilane (hAPTES) forming very glossy capsules. Capsules produced with 3. 0 % hAPTES showed the best <b>mechanical</b> <b>robustness</b> but no ethanol could be produced in dilute-acid spruce hydrolyzate using these capsules. Untreated ACA capsules gave the highest ethanol production but demonstrated poor <b>mechanical</b> <b>robustness.</b> 25 % of the ACA capsules ruptured within 6 h in the shear test. Capsules treated with 1. 5 % hAPTES were significantly stronger, since only 02 % of these capsules broke. Moreover, the ethanol production in the fifth consecutive cultivation in lignocellulose hydrolyzate was nearly as high as for untreated ACA capsules. Conclusion The <b>mechanical</b> <b>robustness</b> of ACA capsules can be easily improved by treating the capsules with hAPTES. ACA capsules treated with 1. 5 % hAPTES showed excellent <b>mechanical</b> <b>robustness</b> and a similar ethanol production profile to untreated ACA capsules...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The elastic moduli of ultrathin poly(styrene) (PS) and poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) {{films of}} {{thickness}} ranging from 200 nm to 5 nm were investigated using a buckling-based metrology.
