"I don't want to disappear": dementia and public autobiographical performance [...] Conclusion. Revisiting my mother's story, my story. This thesis examines {{a select group of}} verbatim and autobiographical theatre productions and applied performance practices which use words and stories about, with and by people living with a dementia diagnosis (older adults in the main). It highlights the many ethical, political and aesthetic issues arising from the paradox of theatres that rely on narratives from 'real' people being coupled with people not generally deemed to be 'real' (or even 'people'). In so doing, this thesis makes a critical contribution to theatre and performance studies scholarship by uncovering the scarcely explored relationship between narrative and the construction of 'reality' as 'normalcy' that determines 'reality theatre' practise and scholarship. It also investigates and challenges the regnant function of the story itself in dementia cultures (with implications for applied theatre scholarship) as well as in 'reality theatre'. In the progress of one of the diseases in the dementia group, memory, cognitive and linguistic capacities, and narrative fitness will be compromised, at some stages, quite severely. Almost from the moment of diagnosis, people become enmeshed in socio-cultural discourses casting them as 'strangers' or the 'living dead' and not as 'real people', often losing their claim to personhood as a consequence. Using a distinctive set of case studies from Australia and the United States of America, this thesis considers how people diagnosed with dementia are represented to publics, as well as the emergng ways in which people represent themselves, assessing to what extent the 'right kind' of dementia story, one of tragedy, loss of personhood and socio-economic crisis is told. This thesis further proposes that Richard Schechner's concept of 'performance consciousness' can re-cast people living with dementia in terms of possibility, not just in terms of tragedy and loss, reframing particular bahviours and actions as creative adaptations rather than just as deficit exemplars of insidious diseases.

5000|$|In 1908, Brodzky went to London {{where he}} studied during 1911 at the City and Guilds South London Technical Art School. He became an {{acquaintance}} and follower of Walter Sickert. Amongst his friends was Henri Gaudier-Brzeska who created in 1913 a portrait bust of Brodzky (now in the Tate Gallery, London), and whose biography he wrote in 1933. Brodzky {{is said to have}} been so engrossed in talk when he visited Gaudier-Brzeska's studio in the King's Road, that he <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> last <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> Herne Hill where he lived. Brodzky travelled to Italy with the poet John Gould Fletcher and this led to his first London exhibition, [...] "Paintings and Sketches of Italian and Sicilian Scenes" [...] (c. 1911), of which one painting was selected for the 1912 Venice Biennale. [...] He was in fact the first Australian to be exhibited at the Biennale. In 1914 his work was exhibited along with that of other Jewish artists, including Mark Gertler and David Bomberg, in the Whitechapel Gallery. Brodzky became a member of the The London Group. During this period he was a pioneer of the technique of linocut, in which medium he has been said to have [...] "excelled". His early oils reveal the influence of both Gertler and Bomberg. Among his works of this period are portraits of Jacob Epstein and Jacob Kramer.|$|R

500|$|There {{was little}} advance {{excitement}} about the pending Warriors-Knicks game that Friday.

Warriors player York Larese said: [...] "The biggest thrill in my life was to see that. There was nothing exciting about the Knicks playing the Warriors in Hershey. Chocolate was more exciting." [...] The game was played at Hershey Sports Arena, an old drafty gym originally built for ice hockey. The league occasionally played games in remote towns to attract new fans. This was the Warriors' third [...] "home" [...] game of the season in Hershey, which was [...] from Philadelphia. [...] The Warriors' Tom Meschery called the arena [...] "god-forsaken place ...
