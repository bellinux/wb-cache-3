40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve surface {{glossiness}} of stainless steel strips in cold rolling, an experiment on roughness and glossiness of SUS 430 ferrite stainless steel {{was carried out in}} laboratory. The relation between roughness and glossiness with reduction in height, roll surface roughness, emulsion parameters was investigated. Roughness and micro defects were analyzed. The effects of micro defects on lubrication oil in deformation zone and reduction were discussed. With the increasing of reduction ratio strip surface roughness Ra(s), Rp(s) and Rv(s) were decreasing along rolling and width direction, the drop value in rolling direction was faster than that in width direction. The roughness and glossiness were obtained under emulsion concentration Ce = 3 % and 6 %, temperature Te = 55 and 63 °C, roll surface roughness Ra(r) = 0. 5, 0. 7 and 1. 0 μm. The glossiness was declined rapidly when the micro defects ratio was above 23 %. When lubrication oil in <b>micro</b> <b>pit</b> of deformation zone was decreased, micro defects were decreased, and glossiness value on the surface of strip was increased...|$|E

The required magnitude of tip relief profile modification depends on the magnitude of tooth elastic deformation that needs to be compensated for. In order to study the effects of linear tip profile modification on gear stress, two matching finite element models of involute spur gear pairs have been created, and tip relief profile modification has been applied to one pair.

40|$|Electrical ageing in {{polymeric}} insulators used in high voltage cables and transformers is often thought to originate in small gas filled voids within {{the bulk of}} the material. Understanding this ageing process is vital as it can lead to electrical treeing and, in some cases, complete electrical failure of the material as an insulator. This paper investigates the chemical processes in electrically aged voids via confocal Raman microprobe spectroscopy (CRMS), a technique well suited to this analysis due to its ability to probe sub surface artefacts in the sample and a resolution of approximately 2 μm in the optical plane. Samples of XLPE layered with sheets of LDPE containing voids of dimensions 0. 4 mm x 0. 1 mm where aged via partial discharge activity and then probed using CRMS. The surfaces of these voids were then analysed using CRMS in conjunction with both air and oil immersion lenses. Analysis revealed among other things, evidence of fluorescence and oxygen related bi-products. The surfaces of the voids were then exposed via microtomy and, following a Raman analysis, imaged using scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|Today’s {{high power}} pulsed laser {{applications}} need optics with coated surfaces {{to improve the}} optical characteristics. A major problem of those layers is the lower laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) compared to the pure substrate. For better understanding of damaging process it is quite necessary to investigate how damages occur. One of these applications are laser systems used in satellites for wind profiling (ADM Aeolus). For best experimental results the testing parameters should be adapted to satellite conditions as good as possible. Therefore all tests are realized in a vacuum chamber under a pressure of 10 - 9 mbar. Furthermore the expected damage size which wants to be observed is {{in the range of}} few microns. This is why a long distance microscope is used in this work to investigate the damage formation online.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the volume {{fraction}} of SiC particulate reinforcements and the concentration of chloride ions in solution on the localized corrosion characteristics of SiCp/ 2024 AI metal matrix composites (MMC) were investigated. A scanning micro reference electrode (SMRE) technique was employed to study the dynamic process of pitting initiation and development {{on the surface of}} the composites at open-circuit potential. Potentiodynamic polarizations were performed to characterize the electrochemical behavior of the MMCs. The morphology of the localized attack on the MMC sample after corrosion tests were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results of electrochemical measurement showed that the composites were less resistant to pit initiation than the corresponding unreinforced metrix alloy. Increase in the volume fraction of SiCp reinforcement in the SiCp/ 2024 Al composites resulted in a significant decrease of pitting potential. In situ potential mapping of active centers on the surfaces of the composites revealed that local breakdown of passivity and initiation of <b>micro</b> <b>pitting</b> corrosion could take place even at an open-circuit potential which was more negative than the pitting potential, and the number of active centers on the surfaces of the composites increased as the volume fraction of SiC particulates in MMCs increased.

40|$|The stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) susceptibility of 7 A 04 high strength aluminum alloy in 3. 5 % (mass fraction) NaCl solution and the Ce 3 + inhibition of SCC were investigated by slow stress rate test(SSRT), using constant current polarization, electrochemical noise (ECN) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The inhibition mechanism of Ce 3 + ions on the initiation and propagation of cracking was also analyzed. The results indicate that both anodic and cathodic galvanostatic polarizations can accelerate the SCC of 7 A 04, the former increases anodic dissolution but the latter accelerates hydrogen embrittlement of crack tip. SCC susceptibility of 7 A 04 can be reduced effectively {{by the addition of}} cerium ions, the fracture time is delayed and slowed down, but only during the initiation other than the propagation stage of cracking. Ce 3 + ions can restrain the initiation of metastable pitting on the surface of 7 A 04 specimen, which therefore increase the induction time of the cracking since that the <b>micro</b> <b>pits</b> are usually the source of cracking. However, once the crack begins to propagate or the specimen is notched, the addition of cerium ions can rarely inhibit the cracking process. This is possibly attributed to that the radius of Ce 3 + ion is too large to diffuse into the crack tip or it is hard to form protective CeO 2 layer, Ce 3 + ion therefore fails to rehabilitate the active alloy at the crack tip and further reduce the SCC developing rate of 7 A 04. SEM also indicates that the crack initiation of smooth 7 A 04 specimens is mainly induced by metastable or stable pits...|$|R
40|$|A gearbox with gears of {{different}} sizes {{is a part of}} the vehicle transmission system that plays an important role in transmitting the engine power. In service, gears fail in many ways but mostly due to surface contact fatigue. Gear failures can cost thousands of dollars. Failure due to contact surface fatigue represents an important fraction on all gear failures (about 20 % according to ASM, 1975) and other failure types can have origin from surface contact fatigue. Micropitting is a kind of surface contact fatigue failure which causes pits on the surface of the gear. It looks like dark gray patches to the naked eye. It can be observed in all types of hardened gears and it can occur at a relatively low number of cycles say less than 106 cycles. Surface roughness has the greatest influence on <b>micro</b> <b>pitting.</b> Compressive residual stresses on the surface of the gears can be beneficial in improving the fatigue life of the gears. The aim of this project is to closely study the evolution of residual stresses and surface topography of ground gears that are contact fatigue tested in FZG test rig. To understand the residual stress state and surface roughness change pattern closely test cycles with relatively small intervals are performed. Residual stress and surface roughness were measured on all the tested gears. This report discusses the evolution of residual stresses and the change of the surface roughness on contact fatigue tested carburized ground spur gears. It is found that micropitting starts to initiate at 200 cycles. Compressive residual stresses on the surface tend to increase after 200 cycles and follow a pattern in decreasing over further testing. But, these stress changes are confined only to 10 microns in depth from the gear surface. It is also found from this study that magnitude of residual stress in the axial direction is only one-third of that in the profile direction. The surface roughness keeps reducing gradually until 63 k Cycles...|$|R
40|$|Boundary {{lubrication}} {{is known}} to be significantly important in the design of machine parts. The decrease in the efficiency of the system as well as its durability when operating in boundary lubrication conditions highlights the importance of this regime. Boundary lubrication involves many different physical, chemical and mechanical phenomena which make it difficult to understand the real mechanisms of friction, wear and lubrication. Tribochemistry is undoubtedly {{one of the most important}} processes occurring in boundary lubrication. Modelling such a complicated process needs a robust physical and chemical modelling framework that is capable of capturing different phenomena. The majority of the modelling attempts in boundary lubrication covers the contact mechanics of rough surfaces with different numerical approaches. Despite the importance of the tribochemistry and its effect in reducing friction and wear of boundary lubricated contacts, there is no comprehensive modelling framework that considers tribochemistry into the boundary lubrication models. In this work, tribochemistry was implemented into the deterministic contact mechanics simulation for elastic-perfectly plastic contact of rough surfaces. A tribochemical model for the growth of the ZDDP antiwear additive was developed based on the thermodynamics of interfaces that combines formation and removal of the tribofilm. The tribochemical model was then coupled with the contact mechanics model which was developed based on potential energy principles. A modification to Archard’s wear equation was proposed which accounts for the role of ZDDP tribofilm in reducing the wear. This model was proposed based on the experimental observations of ZDDP in reducing wear. The numerical framework was then validated against experiments. The wear prediction capability of the model was validated against experiments from Mini-Traction Machine in a rolling/sliding contact. The model is able to predict changes in the topography of the surfaces and this was validated with experiments on a <b>Micro</b> <b>Pitting</b> Rig (MPR). The model shows a good potential in capturing the behaviours in boundary lubrication and opens new ways for further developments and testing the effect of different parameters in tribochemistry and wear. It can give insights in better understanding the real mechanisms of tribochemistry and also help in optimizing boundary lubricated contacts. ...|$|R

High speed test runs restricted increase in speed due to material wear, which eventually affected the life of bearings. Being low saturation temperature fluids, change of phase is very common in refrigerants and cryogenic liquids, which lead to cavitation. Silicon nitride rolling elements with different sintering additives, properties and microstructure were experimentally studied {{to understand the nature}} of cavitation erosion. Advanced surface analysis technique was used study the erosive wear correlation to microstructure of test materials. Cavitation erosion wear initiated by multiple intergranular and transgranular fracture, leading to erosion pit formation. Grain size and grain boundary composition have shown to be the dominant factors for providing resistance to cavitation. Effect of surface defects and lubricant viscosity on cavitation erosion was investigated and is detailed in this thesis. A rotary specimen method was designed to study the effect of cavitation on rolling bodies. Computational modelling of acoustically generated cavitation was attempted and is also reported in this work. A novel test methodology was designed and manufactured by modifying a rotary tribometer to allow controlled experimental testing of two different phenomena rolling contact fatigue and cavitation erosion. This testing made it possible to study rolling and erosive wear mechanisms of rolling elements. Cavitation created far away in this new system is shown to be transported to the rolling contacts.

40|$|The contact {{fatigue failure}} {{in the form of}} <b>micro</b> or macro-scale <b>pitting</b> is an {{important}} failure mode for rolling mechanical elements, such as bearings and gears that are widely used in the automotive, aerospace and wind turbine fields. The micro-pitting process in some cases, gradually removes the surface material through fatigue wear, altering the geometry of the contact surfaces to alleviate the contact pressure decelerating the continued pitting rate. The propagation of the micro-cracks in other cases, goes deep into the material along a shallow angle, turns parallel to the surface at a certain depth, where the maximum shear or material voids or impurities take place, and lastly turns back to the surface, forming macro-sized pits changing the geometry of the contact surface, resulting in large vibration and dynamic behavior of the mechanical components. The propagation of a crack is tightly related to the stress concentration {{in the vicinity of the}} crack tip. This study investigates the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) of Surface Micro-cracks under Hertzian and Sinusoidal pressure distributions considering the effects of surface friction imitating the smooth and rough contact surfaces.

For a better understanding the effect on SCC of FV 520 B, the improved wedge opening loading (WOL) specimens and constant displacement loading methods were employed in experimental research in carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide solution.

A higher antibody reactivity was obtained in FACS analysis by treating the confluent cells with saponin for membrane permeabilization. This indicated that the cryptic gangliosides also existed {{on the surface of}} the plasma membrane. Immunoelectronmicroscopic studies revealed that many <b>micro</b> invaginations and <b>pits</b> were aligned along the plasma membrane, and GM 2 gangliosides were distributed in these structures. Inhibition of caveolae formation with filipin almost fully exposed cryptic GM 2 gangliosides of confluent cells.

These results revealed that these invaginations of the plasma membrane were actually the caveolae and that the mechanism of crypticity of gangliosides was regulated by these microdomains. Recently, many functions have been ascribed to caveolae, where such proteins as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins and low molecular G protein are concentrated, such as transcytosis, potocytosis, and transmembrane signal transduction.

MethodsDisk-shaped Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy was machine milled, the surface was air abraded with alumina, and the alloy was chemically etched with 5 wt% ammonium hydrogen fluoride (F-etch) for 30 s. A phosphate primer (MDP-primer) {{was applied to the}} bonding area, and then a resin composite, with or without milled-fiber resin composite (FRC), was veneered on the specimen. Shear bond strengths were determined after thermocycling for 20, 000 cycles. Bond strength data were analyzed by means of ANOVA and a multiple comparison test (α= 0. 05).

Using an experimental design strategy, electrochemical response surface models of copper versus pH and NaCl concentration were constructed with the minimum number of experiments required. Results show that the electrochemical behavior of copper under corrosive media shows {{significant differences between the}} micro and macro scale experiments. At the <b>micro</b> scale, the <b>pit</b> initiation of copper occurs at more negative potentials for high NaCl concentrations and alkaline pH values.

In this paper, the disc-to-disc tests of the material with 4 % Cr and that with 4 % Cr + Ti were carried out respectively under the conditions of dry contact and emulsion lubricant of 3. 9 % Quakerol N 680 - 2 -DPD. The wear and friction patterns were discussed by correlating the disc surface morphologies and the microstructures of both materials. The surface roughness of the disk of the material with 4 % Cr + Ti deteriorates much slower than that with 4 % Cr under the condition of lubrication. The material with 4 % Cr + Ti is characterised as carbonitrades precipitated in a fine tempered martensite matrix while coarse carbides (M 7 C 3) exist in the material with 4 % Cr. The disk of the material with 4 % Cr + Ti wears differently to that with 4 % Cr. Delamination may become an important wear mechanism earlier in the case of 4 % Cr than that of 4 % Cr + Ti. <b>Micro</b> spalling and <b>pitting</b> occur after 120 min of wear in the case of 4 % Cr, but not in the case of 4 % Cr + Ti until 330 min.
