We designed and developed this software within social constructivism on the basis of 226 students' initial conceptions (categorized in six categories), in order to help students construct appropriate knowledge about the subject. Teaching with the software was conducted in 13 primary, lower secondary and upper secondary school classes. In the software's evaluation research 226 students (aged 11 - 16) and 13 teachers of the classes participated. Data analysis showed students' substantial learning gains with respect to their initial alternative conceptions of the six conceptual categories. Particularly, the students' incorrect answers to the post-test questionnaire have perceptibly decreased (a mean of 65 %). In contrast, their correct answers to the questions reached high percentages, from 60 % to 90 % depending on the question and the students' age. Also the teachers' opinions and comments enhanced software's evaluation.

40|$|Traditionally, the LOTE {{teacher is}} {{positioned}} as the learners' language model. Ingram argues {{that since the}} L 2 is both the target and the medium of instruction 'the teacher is often the principal (if not sole) model of the language for the student'. This implies that the language of instruction should define the particular teaching method. In practice, however, the teacher speaks and writes model dialogues or more precisely model texts that act as {{the major source of}} L 2 input, especially in the initial stages of learning the language. Model dialogues are those 'simulated conversation dialogues found at the beginning of textbook language lessons' presented to learners at any time during a class. These models appear not only in textbooks, but also on cassette tapes, in computer 'interactive' <b>multimedia</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages,</b> on photocopied worksheets, the blackboard, and from teachers' mouths.

[...] Faculty of Education, University of Melbourne, 1997 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the attitudes of female students toward multimedia learning and the way in which they accessed information from an interactive CD-ROM. The CD was an award winning educational software aimed at improving students' understanding of the periodic table and atomic structure. Twenty year- 10 (14 - 15 year old) female students from a girls school in Melbourne, Victoria, participated in the project. An ethnographic approach was adopted which included a pre and post questionnaire and some videotaped laboratory observations. Results indicated that female students were generally aware of the value of multimedia learning programs and showed strong interest toward multimedia learning though they did not register a special preference toward multimedia learning in comparison with traditional ways of teaching (teacher talking and using textbooks). After working with the CD-ROM, no significant change was noticed in students' interest toward multimedia learning, their confidence in ability to learn and use <b>multimedia</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages,</b> and personal preference of instruction mode. Direct observation of students' interaction with the CD-ROM revealed that there was a strong tendency by the students not to access unfamiliar topics/areas. They tended to choose aspects of the CD-ROM that offered little learning difficulty or presented quick responses to short term goals. They spent most (60 %) of their available time on the quiz section and ignored the tutoring aspects of the CD-ROM. According to the result of an opinion poll, students stated that the quiz game aspect of the CD was the most interesting area. Overall, students were unable or unwilling to explore the contents of the CD-ROM in a judicious way when teacher instruction or guidance was absent.

This project studies {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} interactive multimedia and intelligent tutoring systems, and analyses the ways of combining these technologies in search of an interesting, learnable, flexible, compelling and technology-enhanced educational tool. Educational packages need to be evaluated for effectiveness. When it comes to computer-based instruction, technical concerns such as multimedia effects are taken seriously and there is not enough emphasis on its educational value. There is not much concern about the appropriateness of the instruction method to the computer medium. This research proposes a framework for evaluating educational packages which include a number of issues. Several pieces of educational software were evaluated using this framework and Diagnosis for crop protection, a <b>multimedia</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> that aids in teaching the process of diagnosing crop problems, was selected for modification, as a practical application of the theoretical work. We studied different multimedia system development models and methodologies. We also analysed the cognitive issues and intelligent features that enhance the learnability.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the issue of}} linguistic politeness in English with specific reference to Japanese ESL speakers. It develops a theoretical framework that sees shared assumptions concerning the marking of social-power and social-distance differentials as crucial. Developing the notion that linguistic politeness {{is a function of}} a status-dependent and context-dependent variety of language usage, it argues that there are four fundamental types of utterances, and that speech acts conforming to any of the power and distance configurations by means of which these four utterance types are defined can be considered to be polite if-but only if -both speaker and hearer have similar conceptions of their role-relationship within a given speech event. It argues further that perceptions of role-relationships -for both native speakers of Australian English and for Japanese ESL speakers-result from culturally codified understandings of family, and that these understandings provide the primary conceptual template for social actors manufacture and maintenance of social reality in extra-familial face-to-face interaction. As these conceptual templates are not congruent across cultures in the ways in which familial power and distance variables are codified, however, neither are the role-relationships in terms of which extra-familial social encounters are framed; and this, in tum, can lead to Japanese ESL speakers using politeness strategies in contextually inappropriate ways. From this theoretical perspective, the research uses a custom-designed interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> to compare choices of utterances with verified power and distance configurations made by Japanese ESL speakers with choices made by native speakers of Australian English in a variety of everyday speech situations...|$|E

If you wish to reproduce {{more than two hundred}} words of the thesis in any single publication then please contact the author directly. The aim of this project is to conceptualise, develop and realise an appropriate instructional design model for a humanistic integrated multimedia Computer-Enhanced Language Learning (CELL) package for self-access language learning. Previous language learning software programs have typically been technology-driven or pedagogy-driven rather than learner- or learning-driven. As a result, many of the programs currently available or under development are not compatible with modern principles of communicative or learner-centred language learning. Although one of the oft-cited advantages of learning using computer technology is that learners can work at their own pace and in their own time, many software programs fail {{to take full advantage of}} the technology in the design of the flow of control between lessons, help, feedback, and learners. In a self-access program in particular, it is important that learners understand how to learn autonomously, and that they know how to use the software program effectively. In order to develop a program which helps learners towards autonomous learning, the design process needs to focus on the needs and characteristics of learners, principles of learner-centredness, appropriate strategies for effective autonomous learning, and how these relate together. The approach taken in the overall design process is a sociocultural one, modelled on Vygotskian (1978) principles, with the software program and learning materials filling the role of mediators in the language learning process. The flow of control in the CELL package based on these principles is flexible enough to allow autonomous learners to control the order, pace, level, and material which they access, as well as providing flexible modes of interaction. This flexibility is necessary to cater for individual differences in learning styles, including preferred channels of sensory perception and cognitive processing. Since many users of language learning software are computer novices, the interface to the software needs to be easy to navigate. The listening and viewing tasks forming the CELL software package realised in this work are designed to minimise the cognitive or response demands being made on learners until they have more confidence, or until they are more proficient in the language being learnt. The package which should be regarded as a ‘proof of concept’, provides learners, at whatever level of second language proficiency, with the means of gaining access to meaning through the medium of authentic video material. This is achieved by adjusting the task demands according to a hierarchic taxonomy, to accommodate the difficulty of the material. Information on effective language learning strategies is incorporated into the package, while the use of these strategies is demonstrated and practised through the listening and viewing comprehension tasks themselves. This project therefore brings together the theories and research findings from disparate disciplines to produce an instructional design model for a <b>multimedia</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> for second language learning. After surveying and examining the findings from these areas, it is concluded that a sociocultural approach to language learning is compatible with principles of Computer Enhanced Language Learning. A multimedia software program model designed for self-access use based on these principles, together with those of autonomous language learning and awareness-raising in appropriate strategy use, is proposed. The prototype multimedia program which exemplifies the instructional design principles derived from the previous examination is then presented. Information collected using this prototype as a tool can be analysed to provide us with useful information on how learners interact with the multimedia language learning program, the choices they make, and the use they make of the help and exploration tools incorporated into the program. This information will assist researchers in the task of evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of specific aspects and components of the program in order to determine those characteristics of a multimedia language program that promote optimal learning in a Computer-Enhanced Language Learning environment...|$|E

Data of 55 (tablet n = 24, controls n = 31) male 36. 4 %, median age 28 years, 65. 5 % students, were evaluable. The mean MKSAP® score improved in the tablet PC (score Δ + 8 SD: 11), but not the control group (score Δ- 7, SD: 11), respectively. After adjustment for baseline score and confounders the Tablet PC group showed on average 11 % better MKSAP® test results compared to the control group (p< 0. 001).
