5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the universe is dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E

5|$|Though {{similar in}} their {{formation}} process, oil shales differ from coals in several distinct ways. The precursors {{of the organic}} <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> oil shale and coal differ {{in a sense that}} oil shale is of algal origin, but may also include remains of vascular land plants that more commonly compose much of the organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> coal. The origin of some of the organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> oil shale is obscure {{because of the lack of}} recognizable biologic structures that would help identify the precursor organisms. Such materials may be of bacterial origin or the product of bacterial degradation of algae or other organic matter.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic <b>matter.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Kinematic {{studies of}} <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the Milky Way and other galaxies have {{demonstrated}} {{that there is more}} mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.|$|E

5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic.
