5|$|Throughout history, <b>mothers</b> <b>have</b> {{been portrayed}} {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that {{this has to do}} with the idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. <b>Mothers</b> <b>have</b> been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much {{has been written}} about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. <b>Mothers</b> <b>have</b> been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The present {{research}} aimed to compare anxiety and hope between <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from autism syndrome and Down syndrome. Methods: This research used a descriptive-comparative method and {{the sample of}} the study included 60 <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from autism and down syndromes. The sample was selected among all <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children {{in the age of}} 6 - 12 who were suffering from autism and Down syndrome in Kerman in 2014. In order to measure the variables of the research we used 2 questionnaires, the Pennsylvania anxiety questionnaire and the scale of aptitude toward hope among adults. Results: The results showed that the amount of anxiety and hope among <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from autism was different from <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from Down syndrome. Conclusion: The anxiety between <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with autism syndrome was more than <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with Down syndrome. The level of hope between <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with Down syndrome was higher than <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with autism syndrome.

Kitty <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> cottony tails, puppy <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> either silky or cottony ears and bunny <b>mothers</b> <b>had</b> cottony tails and silky forelocks. There were also Nursery Family sets, featuring the puppy and kitty characters.|$|R
5|$|Mother rodents {{provide both}} direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, and indirect parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where <b>mothers</b> <b>have</b> communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.|$|E
5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced <b>mothers</b> <b>have</b> the highest survival rates.|$|E
5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling <b>mothers</b> <b>have</b> better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the {{difficulties}} encountered by the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with mental disabilities or autism in participating to community life. The participants were 21 <b>mothers</b> who <b>have</b> mentally handicapped child and 21 <b>mothers</b> who <b>have</b> child with autism from Istanbul, Turkey. Data was collected through semi-structured interview technique. Nine community skill areas were determined. The results indicated that the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with autism had more difficulties in participating to the community life than the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with mental disabilities. While the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with mental disabilities declared that they experience most difficulties at visiting their neighbors or close relatives, the <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children with autism declared that they experience most difficulties in going to somewhere from another place as a pedestrian.

25|$|The {{inability}} {{to use the}} income and time of two spouses has a harmful effect upon the work opportunities of lower-income mothers. Another factor is income: single-mothers tend to work lower income wage, which come with few benefits such as maternity leave, health insurance, childcare, and flexible schedules. Low-wage work oftentimes is characterized by weekly schedule changes, little flexibility, and extreme short notice for changes. As a result, lower class <b>mothers</b> <b>have</b> a greater a time crunch and more conflict in balancing their work needs with those of their children. Single mother home environments are much poorer because of nonstandard hours and schedules.|$|E
25|$|Lower-class {{families}} are disproportionately {{made up of}} single mother households. According to Kathryn Edin, {{this is because of}} the lack of incentive to marry other lower class men among lower class women, and the desire to save marriage for more quality prospects. Unlike middle class women, lower class women do not have the same financial and marriage incentives to marry especially in the face of likely divorce. As a result, lower class <b>mothers</b> <b>have</b> less incentive to delay their childbearing to later years. Many of the problems shared by single parents are disproportionately felt by the lower class for these very reasons.|$|E
25|$|The median wasp, as in {{all other}} Hymenoptera species, {{produces}} females from fertilized diploid eggs, but males are produced from unfertilized haploid eggs. This means that although workers are unable to mate they can still produce male offspring. This type of sex determination is known as haplodiploidy. The result is that brothers have a relatedness of 0.5 as expected of full siblings, but sisters have a higher relatedness of 0.75. Sisters receive half of their mother’s genes {{as well as all}} their father’s genes because all of the sperm he produces are identical. <b>Mothers</b> <b>have</b> a relatedness of 0.5 to both their sons and daughters.|$|E
