50|$|The {{town was}} first {{mentioned}} in a 1270 deed issued by Henry of Ostheeren, Bishop of Brandenburg. Then a {{possession of the}} Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, it appeared as a town in 1314 under Margrave Waldemar, who in 1317 concluded the Treaty of Templin here, ending the war against Denmark, Mecklenburg and the Duchy of Pomerania. Heavily devastated by Danish troops in the Thirty Years' War, Templin from 1816 on belonged to the Prussian province of Brandenburg near the border with Mecklenburg-Strelitz.From 1912 on, Templin was {{the seat of the}} Electoral Brandenburgian boarding school (Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium) established in 1601 by Elector Joachim III Frederick of Hohenzollern at nearby Joachimsthal. The school was finally dissolved in 1953. Today, Templin has a <b>modern</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>school</b> built in 1997.|$|E

From February 1919 he studied jurisprudence and economic science in Göttingen and Hamburg. After the end of his studies in July 1922 he worked as a commercial clerk for three years in two Hamburg export firms. Hereupon followed a job training in the local and provincial administration. Afterwards Nieland went to the small town Kirchhörde (which now forms part of Dortmund) as a candidate for the career of a Westphalian bailiff. His political career started as a head of the district authority in his native town Hagen, later on Nieland became district president in Münster. In June 1925 he completed his political science dissertation on the topic [...] "The power as a governmental concept of law: at the same time an analysis of the German Reich's constitutional law situation under the rule of the Versailles Treaty"(German: [...] "Die Macht als staatlicher Rechtsbegriff: Zugleich eine Untersuchung über die staatsrechtliche Stellung des Deutschen Reiches unter der Herrschaft des Versailler Vertrages").|$|E

50|$|The {{retirement}} of Mr Hancock in 1972 {{coincided with the}} redesignation of the school as a 12-16 school in September of that year. September 1975 saw the school follow suit of all other secondary <b>modern</b> and <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> in Dudley (which Brierley Hill district became part of in 1966) by converting to comprehensive status. It retained comprehensive status until closure; however, the age range was reverted to 11-16 in September 1990.|$|R
50|$|When the United Kingdom Government {{passed the}} Education Act 1944 a Tripartite System was {{established}} dividing Secondary schools into three categories, <b>Grammar</b> <b>schools,</b> Technical schools and <b>Modern</b> <b>Schools.</b> The <b>grammar</b> <b>school</b> was deemed {{the place of}} education for the academically gifted (as determined by the 11-plus exam) and Richmond County School for Girls became a <b>grammar</b> <b>school.</b> This led to the colloquial name of Richmond <b>Grammar</b> <b>School</b> for Girls.|$|R
50|$|The County <b>Modern</b> and <b>Grammar</b> <b>School</b> merged in 1971 {{to become}} Malton School, a {{comprehensive}} school.

2500|$|In 1977 the Local Education Authority {{appealed to}} keep its <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> rather than be forced by the {{government}} to adopt a comprehensive system. The Lord of Appeal Lord Lane was personally critical of Fred Mulley, the Secretary of State for Education and Science for being [...] "far from frank" [...] about his reason for intervening in Tameside and joined in the judgement which found for Tameside and brought a halt to comprehensivisation. However, following the election of a Labour council in 1980 the local <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> were abolished and all the secondary <b>modern</b> and <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> in Stalybridge, Hyde and Dukinfield became comprehensives.|$|R

25|$|Dudley {{traditionally}} ran {{a system}} of 5–7 infant, 7–11 junior and 11+ secondary schools, but in September 1972 the system was altered to create 5–8 first, 8–12 middle and 12+ secondary schools– this affected the towns of Dudley, Sedgley, Coseley and Brierley Hill, while the traditional system remained in Kingswinford. Secondary <b>modern</b> and <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> were replaced by comprehensive schools in September 1975, and since that date all state secondary schools in the borough have been comprehensive.|$|R
5000|$|Prescriptive grammar {{is taught}} in primary and {{secondary}} school. The term [...] "grammar school" [...] historically refers to a <b>school</b> teaching Latin <b>grammar</b> to future Roman citizens, orators, and, later, Catholic priests. In its earliest form, [...] "grammar school" [...] referred to a school that taught students to read, scan, interpret, and declaim Greek and Latin poets (including Homer, Virgil, Euripides, Ennius, and others). These {{should not be confused}} with the related, albeit distinct, <b>modern</b> British <b>grammar</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|R

After national service, he taught in primary, secondary <b>modern</b> and <b>grammar</b> <b>schools.</b> This wide-ranging experience {{played a significant role in}} shaping his view that music should be at the heart of the curriculum.|$|R
50|$|The {{local high}} school is Thorpe St Andrew High School; it was {{established}} {{in its present form}} in 1977, with what are now the North and South sites of the high school being separate Secondary <b>Modern</b> and <b>Grammar</b> <b>schools</b> respectively from their initial opening in the late 50s/early 60s.The high school is fed by several small primary schools from the local villages along with 3 large primary schools within Thorpe St Andrew.

50|$|When the United Kingdom Government {{passed the}} Butler Education Act in 1944 a Tripartite System was {{established}} dividing secondary schools into three categories, <b>grammar</b> <b>schools,</b> technical schools and secondary <b>modern</b> <b>schools.</b> The <b>grammar</b> <b>school</b> was deemed {{the place of}} education for the academically gifted (as determined by the 11-plus) and Kingsbury County School was selected to become the <b>grammar</b> <b>school</b> {{at which point the}} school changed its name to Kingsbury County <b>Grammar</b> <b>School.</b> The headmaster, Dr Payling (who had succeeded Mr Tracy after his retirement in 1949), saw the beginning of extensions in 1954.|$|R

50|$|In 1967 the Conservatives {{unexpectedly}} won {{control of}} the Inner London Education Authority and the party leadership was horrified to discover that their newly elected councillors {{were going to try}} to break up comprehensive schools and replace them with secondary <b>modern</b> and <b>grammar</b> <b>schools.</b> Chataway, with relevant ministerial experience, was persuaded to take over. He was elected an Alderman and appointed Leader of the Education Committee. Eventually cajoling his colleagues into a more moderate line, he avoided a head-on collision with Edward Short (the Labour Education Secretary) and proceeded with those schemes for secondary reorganisation that he regarded as well founded.|$|R
50|$|The school {{used to be}} on {{two sites}} - the former {{secondary}} <b>modern</b> and <b>grammar</b> <b>school,</b> being separated by Davenport Drive. This was not of greatest benefit to school administration, and with falling numbers of pupils, the school's students all moved to the upper school site in September 2008. There were plans to merge the school with St Mary's Catholic School on Wootton Road in Nunsthorpe (another low performing school) and have a joint school on the Upper School site at Chatsworth Place. This site was also next to St Joseph's RC Primary School on Philip Avenue.|$|R
50|$|The working-class {{intake of}} the schools was limited because parents were deterred by the fees, only partly made up by {{scholarships}} and bursaries, and later by the regime and curriculum of the <b>grammar</b> <b>school.</b> When the United Kingdom Government passed the Education Act 1944, the Tripartite System was established, dividing secondary schools into three categories, the <b>grammar</b> <b>school,</b> the secondary technical school and the secondary <b>modern</b> <b>school.</b> The <b>grammar</b> <b>school</b> was deemed the place of education for the academically gifted (as determined by the 11-plus), and the high schools were selected to become the <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> (hence, the informal term Cardiff <b>Grammar</b> <b>School</b> applied to both).|$|R
50|$|Formal higher {{education}} in the arts and sciences in Wales, from the Dark Ages to the 18th century, was the preserve of the wealthy and the clergy. As in England, Welsh history and archaeological finds dating back to the Bronze Age reveal not only reading and writing, but also alchemy, botany, advanced maths and science. Following the Roman occupation and the conquest by the English, education in Wales was at a very low ebb in the early modern period; in particular, formal education was only available in English while {{the majority of the population}} spoke only Welsh. The first <b>modern</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin, Brecon, and Cowbridge. One of the first modern national education methods to use the native Welsh language was started by Griffith Jones in 1731. Jones was the rector of Llanddowror from 1716 and remained there for the rest of his life. He organized and introduced a Welsh medium circulating school system, which was attractive and effective for Welsh speakers, while also teaching them English, which gave them access to broader educational sources. The circulating schools may have taught half the country's population to read. Literacy rates in Wales by the mid-18th century were one of the highest.|$|R
50|$|Most schools {{came under}} state {{control in the}} Victorian era; a formal state school system was instituted after the Second World War. Initially, schools were {{categorised}} as infant schools, primary schools and secondary schools (split into more academic <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> and more vocational secondary modern schools). Under the Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s most secondary <b>modern</b> and <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> were combined to become comprehensive schools. England has many independent (fee-paying) schools, some founded hundreds of years ago; independent secondary schools are known as public schools. Eton, Harrow, Shrewsbury and Rugby are four of the best-known. Most primary and secondary schools in both the private and state sectors have compulsory school uniforms. Allowances are almost invariably made, however, to accommodate religious dress, including the Islamic hijab and Sikh bangle (kara).|$|R
50|$|Nick Gibb {{was born}} in Amersham, Buckinghamshire and was educated at Bedford <b>Modern</b> <b>School,</b> Maidstone <b>Grammar</b> <b>School,</b> Roundhay School in Leeds, and Thornes House School in Wakefield.

50|$|Between 1958 and 1968 {{the school}} roll was bolstered by {{children}} from Radyr {{on the other}} side of Cardiff as it was quicker and easier for them to travel the nine miles by train to Penarth and attend either St Cyres Secondary <b>Modern</b> or Penarth <b>Grammar</b> <b>School,</b> than it was to walk or drive to nearer Cardiff schools. The arrangement only ceased when the direct rail link was removed by the Beeching axe.|$|R
50|$|The 1976 Education Act {{abolished}} the tripartite education system of <b>grammar</b> and secondary <b>modern</b> <b>schools</b> in England and Wales. Up to this point, {{the area was}} served by The Kings of Wessex School secondary <b>modern</b> and Sexey's <b>Grammar</b> <b>School</b> in Blackford near Wedmore.In 1976, the three-tier Cheddar Valley Community Learning Partnership was established, creating a system of first, middle and comprehensive upper schools in the area.

5000|$|By 1975 the {{majority}} of local authorities in England and Wales had abandoned the 11-Plus examination {{and moved to a}} comprehensive system. Over that 10-year period many secondary <b>modern</b> <b>schools</b> and <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> were amalgamated to form large neighbourhood comprehensives, whilst a number of new schools were built to accommodate a growing school population. By the mid-1970s the system had been almost fully implemented, with virtually no secondary <b>modern</b> <b>schools</b> remaining. Many <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> were either closed or changed to comprehensive status. Some local authorities, including Sandwell and Dudley in the West Midlands, changed all of its state secondary schools to comprehensive schools during the 1970s.|$|R

Nearly all new schools were built as comprehensives, and existing <b>grammar</b> and <b>modern</b> <b>schools</b> had either been closed (see for example the Liverpool Institute) or amalgamated with neighbouring secondary moderns to produce comprehensive schools.

50|$|The Wheat Street culvert was {{constructed}} in 1861 as part of Brisbane city's drainage system, {{and was one of}} the first civil engineering projects of the newly formed Brisbane Municipal Council. In 1825 the penal settlement at Moreton Bay was moved from Redcliffe to Brisbane, where a reliable supply of water could be found. This was the Wheat Creek (also known as the 'Big Creek') that rose near the site of the <b>modern</b> Brisbane <b>Grammar</b> <b>School,</b> in College Road. The creek flowed through what was later the Roma Street railway yards, forming a lagoon between modern George and Roma Streets and to the so-called horse pond formerly in front of the present Brisbane City Hall site. From here the creek flowed diagonally across the present Adelaide and Albert Streets intersection between Queen and Adelaide Streets and entered the river at the end of the present Creek Street. The bed of the creek is still visible down the service laneways in Adelaide Street.|$|R
5|$|The {{educational}} opportunities for secondary modern pupils were limited compared to those at <b>grammar</b> <b>schools,</b> prompting criticism of the selection system; <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> and the eleven plus were also criticised for alienating working-class families. A reluctance to improve secondary <b>moderns</b> or expand <b>grammar</b> <b>schools</b> under the Conservatives prompted the Labour Government to issue Circular 10/65 in 1965 which requested local education authorities convert to a comprehensive system. In 1971, Sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education, but rejected the Council's proposals. New plans were unveiled in 1973: the High School and the Secondary Modern sites were to become mixed 11–16 schools and Carre's would become a sixth form college. Parents voted for the plans (1,199 to 628), albeit with a 50% turnout. The County Council approved them, but allowed governors a veto. Following negotiations with governors at Carre's, the scheme was revised in 1974 so that Carre's and the High School became 11–18 schools; the secondary modern would be closed, Westholme absorbed by the High School and the Church Lane site by Carre's.|$|R
