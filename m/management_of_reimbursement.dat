40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the relevance of}} explanatory factors of the lack <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> in microfinance conceived {{on the side of}} the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the micro-borrowers. In fact, these factors have generally been little discussed in the literature. This research, falls under this objective to explore the context of the microfinance as regards lack <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> and to find solutions to minimize this risk of insolvency. In other words, the issue is connected to the identification of the influence of the characteristics specific to the micro-borrowers on the probability so that an individual carries out a lack <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> To study the determinants <b>of</b> the <b>reimbursement</b> rate <b>of</b> the micro-borrowers, this paper is divided into three principal parts. First of all, on the basis of the theoretical framework, we will focus ourselves particularly, on the explanatory factors of the lack <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> in microfinance which are related to the particular characteristics of the micro-borrowers, and we will try also to formulate the fundamental assumptions of our research. Then, we will discuss our sample and our results of estimates in order to treat our fundamental question of research. At this level, we will try to empirically analyze the validity of the assumptions by the presentation and the analysis of the principal results, in order to identify the explanatory factors of the lack <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> {{on the side of the}} micro-borrowers...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cardiac {{rehabilitation}} (CR) programs play {{an important}} role in the control and prevention of new cardiac events. Aim: A survey was performed to evaluate the current situation of CR programs in Chile. Material and Methods: A questionnaire evaluating the structure of rehabilitation centers, characteristics of the rehabilitation programs and patients, <b>management</b> <b>of</b> risk factors, <b>reimbursement</b> methods, human resources and potential barriers for an efficient rehabilitation, was mailed to centers dedicated to CR in Chile. Results: Eight centers were contacted and seven responded. Coronary heart disease is the most common underlying disease of attended patients and CR is carried out mainly during phases II and III. All CR centers perform an initial assessment, stratify patients, plan and provide tips on physical activity and nutrition. Only three centers provide help to quit smoking. Lipid profile and blood sugar are assessed in 62 % of centers. Most practitioners involved are cardiologists, nurses, physiotherapists and nutritionists, all trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The main barrier for their development is the lack of patient referral from practitioners. Conclusions: Despite the recognized value of CR in the care of patients after a cardiac event, this study reveals the need for further development of such programs and improvement of patient referrals...|$|R

40|$|The {{companion}} {{paper on}} nursing home levels of care (Bishop, Plough and Willemain, 1980) recommended a "split-rate " approach to nursing home reimbursement that would distinguish between fixed and variable costs. This paper examines three alternative treatments of the variable cost {{component of the}} rate: a two-level system similar to the distinction between skilled and intermediate care facilities, an individualized ("patient-centered") system, and a system that assigns a single facility-specific rate {{that depends on the}} facility's case-mix ("case-mix reimbursement"). The aim is to better understand the theoretical strengths and weaknesses of these three approaches. The comparison <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> alternatives is framed in terms <b>of</b> minimizing <b>reimbursement</b> error, meaning overpayment and underpayment. We develop a conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> error that stresses that the features <b>of</b> the <b>reimbursement</b> scheme are only some of the factors contributing to over- and underpayment.

In this study we combined these to generate estimates for hourly rates <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> across 78 common operations in eight surgical subspecialties, for anaesthetists and surgeons.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionIntramuscular {{injection}} of botulinum toxin (BoNTA) {{is one of}} the primary treatments for focal spasticity. This treatment is considered costly and the level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by health insurance has been decreasing in many countries for several years. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the real cost of treating spasticity with BoNTA and to compare this with the level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by the national health insurance in France in 2008 and with a new fee, specific to the {{injection of}} BoNTA in ambulatory services. MethodA single-center, retrospective study using the 2008 database from a French secondary-care day-hospital unit (treating spasticity in adults with sequelae of stroke, multiple sclerosis or traumatic brain injuries). The level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by the French ministry of health for BoNTA treatment for adults with spasticity constituted the “calculated cost” and corresponded to the hospital's “budget”. The “real cost” (incurred by the hospital) included the sum of staffing and material costs as well as the number of toxin vials used. The calculated costs for 2009 and 2013 were based on the levels <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> during those years. The difference between real and calculated cost for 2009 and 2013 was estimated considering that the real cost of 2008 was stable. ResultsIn 2008, 364 patients received BoNTA, resulting in 870 day-hospital admissions. The calculated cost was 459, 056 €/year and the real cost was 567, 438 €/year (equivalent to 4. 27 €/day/patient). The total budget deficit (hospital income minus hospital costs) was 108, 383 €. The deficit was estimated at 222, 892 € in 2009 and 241, 188 € in 2013. ConclusionThe daily cost of BoNTA treatment for spasticity is reasonable; however, because of the level <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> by the national health insurance in France, the treatment is costly for French hospitals...|$|R

40|$|Though {{evidence-based}} treatments {{have been}} recommended for breast cancer, underuse of the treatments was still observed. To certain extent, patients' access to care, {{which can be}} enhanced by increasing the coverage of health insurance, {{could account for the}} current underuse in recommended care. This study aimed to examine the association between different proportions <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> and quality <b>of</b> recommended breast cancer care, as well as length of hospital stay. In this retrospective study, 3669 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1 June, 2011 and 30 June, 2013 were recruited. Seven quality indicators from preoperative diagnosis procedures to adjuvant therapy and one composite indicator were selected as dependent variables. Logistic regression and generalized linear models were used to explore the association between quality of care and length of hospital stay with different reimbursement rates. Compared with UEBMI (urban employment basic medical insurance), which represented high level reimbursement rate, patients with lower rates <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> were less likely to receive core biopsy, HER- 2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2) testing, BCS (breast conserving surgery), SLNB (sentinel lymph nodes biopsy), adjuvant therapy and hormonal treatment. No significant difference in preoperative length of hospital stay was observed among the three insurance schemes, however URBMI (urban resident basic medical insurance) insured patients stayed longer for total length of hospital stay. Significant disparities in utilization of evidence-based breast cancer care among patients with different proportions <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> were observed. Patients with lower rate <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> were less likely to receive recommended care. Our findings could provide important support for further healthcare reform and quality improvement in breast cancer care...|$|R
