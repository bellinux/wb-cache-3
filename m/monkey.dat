5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American squirrel <b>monkey</b> was just a population of a South American species of squirrel <b>monkey</b> brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American squirrel <b>monkey</b> and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel <b>monkey</b> species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American squirrel <b>monkey</b> is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that <b>monkey</b> lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the <b>monkey</b> lemurs or the sloth lemurs were {{more closely related to}} today's indriids. The <b>monkey</b> lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the <b>monkey</b> lemurs were more closely related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the <b>monkey</b> lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine whether access to mother-peer (MP) reared rhesus <b>monkeys</b> (Macaca mulatta) affected the behavior and physiology of juvenile and adolescent surrogate-peer (SP) and peer-only reared (PR) <b>monkeys.</b> <b>Monkeys</b> were housed in a mixed-rearing group (MP, SP, and PR together) or two same-rearing groups (one MP group and one SP and PR group). The studies of this dissertation used behavior and physiology to test three prediction models: SP and PR <b>monkeys</b> would be more similar to MP <b>monkeys</b> in the mixed-rearing group compared to the same-rearing group (acculturation model), more different (dissimilation model), or there would be no effect of MP <b>monkeys</b> in the mixed-rearing group (stability model). ^ In experiment one, basic behavioral responses of 14 -month old nursery reared <b>monkeys</b> were consistent with the stability model; however, SP <b>monkeys</b> showed a greater magnitude of difference in initiated social behavior than PR <b>monkeys.</b> In experiment two, SP <b>monkeys</b> preferred both SP and MP partners almost equally for all behaviors in the mixed-rearing group (acculturation model), whereas PR <b>monkeys</b> showed little fluctuation in partner preferences, preferring primarily other PR <b>monkeys</b> as partners (stability model). Also, there were more aggressive responses to aggressive interactions in SP <b>monkeys</b> in the mixed-rearing group (dissimilation model), whereas PR <b>monkeys</b> were similar to MP <b>monkeys</b> (stability model). In experiment three, plasma cortisol (CORT) of 14 - and 26 -month old SP <b>monkeys</b> and of 37 - and 49 -month old SP <b>monkeys</b> was similar to MP <b>monkeys</b> of the same ages. However, CORT of PR <b>monkeys</b> became more similar to MP <b>monkeys</b> over time in the mixed-rearing group. Variation in CORT among differently reared <b>monkeys</b> was also reduced over time. ^ Mixed-rearing housing resulted in behavioral acculturation of SP <b>monkeys</b> and the physiological acculturation of PR monkeys; however, it is possible that SP <b>monkeys</b> showed physiological acculturation prior to our blood sampling and PR <b>monkeys</b> showed behavioral acculturation after our behavioral sampling. Thus, future studies evaluating <b>monkeys</b> in same- and mixed-rearing groups are necessary in order to examine this timing effect of behavioral and physiological acculturation. ...|$|R

The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as <b>Monkey</b> Ball, an arcade cabinet running on Sega's NAOMI hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due {{to the failure of}} Sega's Dreamcast home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed Super <b>Monkey</b> Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for Nintendo hardware.|$|E

40|$|Most New World <b>monkeys</b> have an X-chromosome opsin gene {{polymorphism}} {{that produces a}} variety of different colour vision phenotypes. Howler <b>monkeys</b> (Alouatta), one of the four genera in the family Atelidae lack this polymorphism.

In order to determine whether closely related <b>monkeys</b> share this arrangement, spectral sensitivity functions that allow inferences about cone pigments were measured for 56 <b>monkeys</b> from two other Atelid genera, spider <b>monkeys</b> (Ateles) and woolly <b>monkeys</b> (Lagothrix). Unlike howler <b>monkeys,</b> both spider and woolly <b>monkeys</b> are polymorphic for their middle- and long-wavelength cone photopigments.
