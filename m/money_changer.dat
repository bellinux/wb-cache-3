John 2:12-25 has the incident occurring {{at the start of}} his book and therefore Jesus ministry. He expels the dove salesman and <b>money</b> <b>changers</b> but does not quote from the Old Testament, instead saying [...] "How dare you turn my Fathers house into a market!". The disciples remember [...] "Zeal for your house will consume me." [...] Most scholars hold that this is the same incident and that it really occurred shortly before Jesus death. A minority hold that there were two incidents with the <b>money</b> <b>changers,</b> once at the beginning and once at the end of Jesus mission.|$|R
