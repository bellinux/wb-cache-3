25|$|Vitamin C (or ascorbic acid) {{is present}} in the grape and the must up to 50 <b>milligrams</b> <b>per</b> <b>litre.</b> It is a {{protection}} in the wort against the oxidation phenomenon. In the presence of oxygen it produces hydrogen peroxide; by this reaction it deprives the enzymes in the wort of oxygen that is necessary to oxidize the wine. Since 1962 the addition of vitamin C in the wine has been allowed to a maximum of 15 grams per hectolitre at the time of packaging to stabilize the wine. Experiments in the late 2000s tried to determine a method to add it to fresh harvests or in the wort.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B1 or {{thiamine}} {{is present}} at a concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 <b>milligrams</b> <b>per</b> <b>litre.</b> This vitamin {{is necessary for}} the proper growth of yeasts that ensure alcoholic fermentation. In the must of healthy grapes the natural quantity is sufficient for the yeast. On the other hand, for a degraded harvest (by gray mold), the degradation of this vitamin leads the winemaker to add it to the must to ensure a trouble-free fermentation. In the case of a harvest with a very clear wort and low temperature the yeast works in a limited way and the addition of thiamine can help avoid a difficult end of fermentation. Legislation limits the amount added to 30 milligrams per hectolitre.|$|E
500|$|Water {{fluoridation}} is {{the controlled}} addition of fluoride {{to a public}} water supply to reduce tooth decay. Fluoridated water contains fluoride {{at a level that}} is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth, it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva, which reduces the rate at which tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes {{in the early stages of}} cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $ per person-year. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. In 2011 the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5mg/L (<b>milligrams</b> <b>per</b> <b>litre),</b> depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride. [...] Bottled water typically has unknown fluoride levels.|$|E

Addition Of oligosaccharides, derived from sodium alginate and locust bean gum, to submerged cultures of P. chrysogenum P 2, at <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> <b>litre</b> concentration (150 mgL- 1), increased secondary metabolite levels and spore production, caused changes in morphology and gerRiination of spores, and affected the production of Reactive Oxygen Species. The source of the oligosaccharides controlled their effects on the cultures. Oligosaccharides when added to submerged cultures of P. chrysogenum P 2 increased both penicillin G and extracellular levels of 6 -aminopenicillanic acid concentrations. The oligosaccharides had no significant effects on biomass levels. Locust bean gum-derived oligosaccharides (mannan oligosaccharides, DP 5 - 8), showed {{the highest levels of}} enhancement in both penicillin G and 6 -aminopenicillanic acid concentrations. Sodium alginate-derived oligosaccharides, (oligoguluronate, DP 7 and oligomannuronate, DP 7), also induced elicitation of penicillin G and 6 -aminopenicillanic acid. Oligomannuronate was shown to be more effective than oligoguluronate.

While the former method identified only 13 elements, the later method was able to identify twenty seven elements. Most of the bars showed conspicuous absence of vital alloying minerals such as Molybdenum, Vanadium, etc that have been indicated by BS 4449 (1997) as strength and coefficient of weldability determinants. For example, under the percentage composition, Magnesium appeared in all the 19 samples, Nickel appeared in 16 out of the 19 samples, while Vanadium appeared in only 3 out of the 19 samples. The presence of some elements such as S ilicon and Phosphorus that are considered impurities coupled with the possible lack of Nitrogen control during production seem to have impacted negatively on the strength and deformation characteristics of the bars...|$|R
40|$|There {{is ample}} evidence, from many places and over many years, that {{fluoridation}} {{of the public}} water supply leads to a substantial reduction in dental caries, with all that means in prevention of suffering, inconvenience and unnecessary cost. It can be shown that the beneficial effect of fluoride is significant, whatever other measures are taken in relation to sound nutrition and preventive dental practice. There are several other ways in which fluoride {{can be used in}} the prevention of dental caries but each of the alternatives has substantial disadvantages compared with the fluoridation of water. The justification for such a measure as the addition of fluoride to the water supplies of entire communities must rely on strong scientific evidence pointing not only to its effectiveness but to its safety, even though the recommended level in the public water supply is similar to that yielded by many natural sources. From the first, therefore, the safety of the fluoridation of water to the optimum concentration (1 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> <b>litre)</b> has been a paramount consideration, and fluoridation programmes were both preceded and accompanied by investigations ofthe healt...|$|R

5000|$|In July 2000 {{there was}} a setback for the {{clean-up}} programme when a pollution incident affected approximately 2.5 mi of the river between Rawtenstall and Ramsbottom, causing the death of more than 36,000 fish.

5000|$|Mixed liquor {{suspended}} solids (MLSS) is {{the concentration of}} {{suspended solids}}, in an aeration tank during the activated sludge process, which occurs during the treatment of waste water. The units MLSS is primarily measured in are <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> <b>litre</b> (mg/L), but for activated sludge its mostly measured in gram per liter g/l which is equal to kilogram per m3 kg/m3. Mixed liquor {{is a combination of}} raw or unsettled wastewater or pre-settled wastewater and activated sludge within an aeration tank. MLSS consists mostly of microorganisms and non-biodegradable suspended matter. MLSS {{is an important part of}} the activated sludge process to ensure that there is a sufficient quantity of active biomass available to consume the applied quantity of organic pollutant at any time. This is known as the food to microorganism ratio, more commonly notated as the F/M ratio. By maintaining this ratio at the appropriate level the biomass will consume high percentages of the food. This minimizes the loss of residual food in the treated effluent. In simple terms, the more the biomass consumes the lower the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) will be in the discharge. It is important that MLSS removes COD and BOD in order to purify water for clean surface waters, and subsequently clean drinking water and hygiene. Raw sewage enters in the water treatment process with a concentration of sometimes several hundred mg/L of BOD. Upon being treated with MLSS and other methods of treatment, the concentration of BOD in water is lowered to less than 2 mg/L, which is considered to be clean, safe to discharge to surface waters or to reuse water.|$|R
