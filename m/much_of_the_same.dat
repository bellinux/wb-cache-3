5|$|Going Clear {{is based}} closely on Lawrence Wright's book, {{covering}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{ground with the}} aid of archive footage, dramatic reconstructions, and interviews with eight former Scientologists: Paul Haggis, the Oscar-winning director; Mark Rathbun, the church's former second-in-command; Mike Rinder, {{the former head of the}} church's Office of Special Affairs; the actor Jason Beghe; Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor, former liaison to John Travolta; and former Scientologists Tom DeVocht, Sara Goldberg, and Hana Eltringham Whitfield.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{three years}} after Malaya's independence, the Emergency was {{declared}} over. However, the Malayan Internal Security Act 1960 ("ISA") was passed {{in place of the}} PPSO with <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> powers. During parliamentary debates on the Act, Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman stated that the ISA would only be applied against only the remaining Communist insurgents. The Malayan Communist Party and its insurgents eventually surrendered in 1989. Nonetheless, the ISA was retained in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Mochtar and Soekarsih, {{who first}} {{met on the}} set of Pareh, married after {{appearing}} together in Terang Boelan. This later production included <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> cast and was highly successful, leading to a renewed interest in filmmaking in the Indies. Terang Boelan proved to be the most successful local production until 1953's Krisis (Crisis), released after Indonesia had become independent.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, the Monthly Film Bulletin commented that Tourneur's direction was [...] "handled with <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assurance <b>the</b> <b>same</b> director brought to Cat People" [...] {{and that the}} film was [...] "way above average". The review commented on <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demon, stating whenever the demon takes on a visible form, [...] "especially the ending", it seemed more like a product of [...] "a child's nightmare than an adult's imagination".|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} adapted from a stage play {{entitled}} Pelacur dan Sang Presiden (The Prostitute and the President), which Sarumpaet had written after receiving a grant from UNICEF to study child trafficking trends in Indonesia and promote awareness of the problem. In preparing the script, she spent several months interviewing prostitutes in several cities; the film itself spent three years in production and featured <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> cast and crew as the original play.|$|E
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|Far Side Virtual was {{met with}} {{polarizing}} but generally positive reviews, with most critics commending its conceptual underpinnings and noting its ambiguous relationship to its subject. It was named {{album of the year}} by UK magazine The Wire, a decision which {{was met with}} contention from some journalists and readers. The album has since been cited as one of the original releases and catalysts of vaporwave, an Internet-based electronic music microgenre that covers <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sonic and conceptual territory.|$|E

5|$|Ridership on the Mountaineer {{over its}} two-year {{probationary}} period was disappointing: 58,991 in 1975 and 53,400 in 1976. Averaged over a 365-day year, this was 161 passengers {{per day in}} 1975 and 146 in 1976. By 1977 daily ridership had dwindled to 35. Monetary losses were far higher than expected: $5.7 million in FY1975 and $14.9 million in FY1976. After a brief respite, Amtrak discontinued the Mountaineer on May 31, 1977. A new train, the Hilltopper, operated over <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> route until 1979.|$|E

It is billed {{as an opportunity for}} young racers to experience a mid-distance sled dog race.

5|$|The Orb's album art {{features}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> imagery {{as their}} live act. Graphic design group The Designers Republic created the cover art for the earlier work, including Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, U.F.Orb, and the singles from those two albums. For their next album, the Orb poked fun at their Pink Floyd comparisons with {{the cover of}} Live 93 featuring a floating stuffed sheep over the Battersea Power Station, which had appeared {{on the cover of}} Pink Floyd's Animals. The artwork found in Badorb.com releases was similar to the Orb's odd artwork of the mid-1990s, as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing. Paterson has also dabbled in the creation of cover art himself, designing the cover of Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days prior}} to {{striking}} Florida, the outer circulation began producing rainfall across the state. Storm warnings were issued along {{the east and west}} coastlines northward to Cedar Key and Titusville. Later, hurricane warnings were issued for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> area, and schools in the Tampa area were closed as the storm was expected to move ashore. The hurricane first affected Florida when it passed west of Key West, where sustained winds of 66mph (107km/h), along with gusts to 74mph (120km/h), were reported. Little damage occurred in the region, limited to downed trees; this was due to advance warning by the U.S. Weather Bureau, which advised ships to remain at port and for residents to secure property. Later, the hurricane moved ashore in a sparsely populated region of southwestern Florida. Damage was reported in Fort Myers and Punta Gorda and communications were temporarily cut, although no deaths were reported. Heavy rainfall was reported along its path, and one location accumulated 23.22inches (590mm) in a 24‑hour period; this established a new one-day rainfall record in the state. A station in Miami recorded 12.18inches (309mm), and wind gusts in the area approached hurricane force. The combination of winds and rain damaged 5% of the local citrus and avocado crop. The rainfall flooded streets, homes, and commercial buildings in the Miami area, and hundreds of people were left without telephone access. No impact was reported in the Bahamas.|$|E

The AT laboratory eventually released their own STREAMS library, which incorporated <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> functionality in a software stack with a different architecture, but the wide distribution of the existing sockets library reduced the impact of the new API. Early versions of BSD were used to form Sun Microsystems' SunOS, founding the first wave of popular Unix workstations.|$|E

The film is notable for its avant-garde style with a film noir feel, shot on stark high-contrast black-and-white film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema and German Expressionism. Rumble Fish features an experimental score by Stewart Copeland, drummer of the musical group The Police, who used a Musync, a new device at the time.|$|E
