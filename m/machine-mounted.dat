40|$|Introduction Industrial safety {{professionals}} {{recognize that}} adequate illumination {{is essential to}} a safe and productive work environment. The need for effective, lighting in underground coal mines is even greater. 1 Designing appropriate lighting systems for these mines is no easy [] task because of the unique environment and work procedures encountered in underground coal-mining operations. Miners must depend totally on artificial lighting systems to see. Moreover, the working face is a low-reflectivity and low-contrast environment and is continually advancing or retreating. 2 Laboratory mock-ups {{have been a major}} part of the process lighting equipment manufacturers must under- go to design an underground <b>machine-mounted</b> lighting system. The mock-ups often have taken considerable time. Furthermore, modifications to a lighting system (using different luminaires with an existing configuration or changing a luminaire's location, orientation, etc.) could require more time with additional mock-ups and laboratory measurements. Understanding the need to improve this situation, the US Bureau of Mines has developed an alternate method for facilitating lighting system mock-ups. A PC-Program (CAP),* with the latest software technology enables users to design, alter, and evaluate under- ground <b>machine-mounted</b> illumination systems. Lux levels and distance are measured as the luminaire is moved incrementally through angular traverses about horizontal and vertical axes. The measurements and angles subsequently are entered into the model. From this input data, three-dimensional isolux or isofootcandle profiles are constructed for luminaires that can be placed at various locations and orientations on a mining machine. As an example, Figure 1 shows a computer display of 21. 5 Ix or 2. 00 fc profiles for luminaires mounted on a simulated mine-shuttle car. Using this information, the model allows the user to determine the lux level at different locations in space about the shuttle car. How the model calculates illumination During initial development of the CAP model, the isolux profile of the luminaire was determined using the inverse square law (ISL). 3 The method of gathering data comprised recording a single measurement of distance at 21. 5 21 1. 21 x (2. 00 2111 fc) for angular traverses following 0. 09 rad (5 degree) increments. This data was then used to find the illumination in space for any other distance at a given azimuth and elevation using the ISL. Limitations, however, exist with this method. 4 The main one is that the ISL assumes a luminaire is a single point source of light, so long as the distance is greater than five times the 1 al;gest dimension of the luminous area of the luminaire. 5 Also, by using a single measurement to calculate the illumination for a given luminaire in the CAP model a large error could result from an inaccurate measurement...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{experimental study}} has been conducted using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for {{a wide array of}} ventilation schemes and mining configurations for the purpose of examining ventilation characteristics in dead end mine headings. Flow behaviors in two basic mining sequences of box and slab cuts for 30 ft and 60 ft deep cuts were studied. The present thesis discusses the effect for various geometric and flow parameters including the variation of inlet flow velocities, entry heights, face zone widths and curtain widths on the flow behavior. The Reynolds number Re considered for this study ranges from 1 · 105 to 3 · 106 based on curtain width and exit velocity. The variation of the face zone and the curtain widths considerably affected the flow behavior, resulting in recirculation regions in the face area for critical combinations. Jet spreading angles and virtual origins have been calculated for the different geometries showing that an optimum range of face and curtain widths exists. A detailed discussion employing various scenarios for exhaust ventilation systems has also been made. Full-size measurements and comparison of the experimental data with numerical simulations is presented.

The {{emphasis is on}} the measurement procedure and the interpretation of the measurement rather than on the instrument itself. ] The failure to properly sample for methane is a major contributing factor to methane explosion risk. Sampling errors are most likely to occur at mines or tunnels where the presence of methane is not suspected or during nonroutine tasks at mines or tunnels known to have gas. More specific information on methane sampling at continuous miner sections is in Chapter 3. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss sampling at longwall sections, and Chapter 14 discusses sampling at tunnels.

40|$|The <b>machine-mounted</b> {{continuous}} {{respirable dust}} monitor (MMCRDM) is a fixed-location area sampling device developed for possible {{use at the}} working face of an underground coal mine. This device, based on proprietary technology known as the tapered element oscillating microbalance, has evolved {{over the past eight}} years through a cooperative effort of the former Bureau of Mines, MSHA, and the Rupprecht & Patashnick Company in Albany, NY. The capability to measure respirable coal mine dust levels on a continuous basis, rather than depending solely on periodic samples obtained from the traditional coal mine dust samplers, has been a goal in the mining industry for nearly two decades. Recently, an extensive series of laboratory and underground tests was conducted by NIOSH with the cooperation of MSHA and coal operators to test the performance of the MMCRDM In preliminary laboratory testing, the MMCRDM seemed to work well. However, in every underground test, when compared to reference samplers placed close to the inlet, the MMCRDM failed to meet the 25 % accuracy criterion specified in the contract under which it was developed. Two reasons explain this failure: First, in most tests the bias (the relative discrepancy between the average MMCRDM concentration and the average reference sampler concentration) was too great. Second, the variability of the samplers used for reference comparison was too large. Finally, the underground testing of the MMCRDMs showed that they are quite unreliable at this stage of development. In the majority of mine tests, no more than 10 shifts of data were taken before the MMCRDM failed to function properly. Major breakdowns, requiring the return of the MMCRDM to the factory for repairs, occurred on average every 28 days. To be considered mine-worthy, MMCRDM reliability must be substantially improved.

40|$|The French {{research}} institute, INERIS, {{requested the}} assistance of the CSIR’s Division of Mining Technology in developing further precautionary measures against explosions in their collieries. In response to this approach, an on-board active suppression system was adapted to meet their mining requirements. This system is used on tunnelling machines in Germany where the machine is positioned {{in the middle of the}} tunnel, which is therefore not much wider than the machine itself. With this configuration, the machine is never away from the tunnel face during the cutting cycle. As a result, the possible volume in front of the machine of combustible gas requiring suppression is less than 50 m 3. In South Africa this technology has been adapted to suit a twocut mining method which entails greater distances from the face and thus much larger volumes of methane mixtures requiring suppression. The particular configuration of the Explo-Stop® system being investigated required the suppression of possible methane ignition volumes of up to 180 m 3 of a 9 % per volume methane/air mixture. The volume is a consequence of the large cross-sectional area of French underground workings and of the two-cut mining method used in France. In order to take the second cut in the coal seam, the machine is pulled back a maximum distance of 4 m, leaving an air pocket in which gas can accumulate. The <b>machine-mounted</b> system is required to effectively suppress any flame ignited by such a large accumulated volume of methane. The results of the protocol tests done at Kloppersbos showed that the system was capable of suppressing all simulated methane ignitions for the prescribed conditions. This was achieved with a temperature increase of less than a 100 °C at the operator’s position and without any flame being detected at this position. [URL] Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Until {{the early}} 1980 s, mine face {{ventilation}} systems {{were designed for}} ventilating cutting depths up to 20 feet. Since that time, use of remotely operated mining machines have allowed cutting depths to increase to 40 ft, increasing concerns about the effects on methane levels at the mine face area. The principles for efficient methane control during deeper cutting remained the same, namely: 1. Move a sufficient quantity of intake air {{from the end of}} the tubing or curtain to the face. 2. Mix intake air with methane gas liberated at the face. 3. Move methane contaminated air away from the face. However, when cutting to depths greater than 20 ft (known as deep-cut mining), airflow quantities reaching the face area often decreased because it was difficult to maintain tubing or brattice setback distances. Earlier research showed that use of <b>machine-mounted</b> scrubbers and water sprays increased airflow at the face area during deep cutting. NIOSH research examined how these and other factors affected face airflow. A full-scale ventilation test gallery was used to study how different operating conditions caused airflow patterns and methane distributions near the face to vary. The research results showed that during deep-cut mining: 1. Without additional controls, only a small percentage of the air delivered to the end of the tubing or curtain reached the face area. 2. Operation of a <b>machine-mounted</b> scrubber increased airflow and reduced methane levels at the face area as long as the quantity of intake air delivered to the end of the curtain or tubing was not reduced. 3. Operation of water sprays did not significantly increase the volume of air reaching the face but did improve mixing of methane and intake air at the face. Methane monitoring requirements remained the same for deep cutting, but the possibility of rapidly changing conditions at the face increases the need for accurate estimates of face methane concentration. Research examined currently available instrumentation and sampling methods for monitoring methane at the face. The results from this NIOSH research program demonstrate how existing and new engineering controls can be used to (educe face methane levels. The sampling methods that were investigated can provide better ways to measure methane levels near the front of the continuous mining machine. In this report several practical guidelines are recommended for controlling and monitoring methane levels in the face areas of underground coal mines. Most of the recommendations were based on studies conducted in the NIOSH ventilation test gallery. 1. Free-standing fans can be used to ventilate empty headings in coal mines; a) The fan nozzle should be designed to provide maximum throw distance. b) Recirculation should be minimized by proper placement of fan inlet and or by placing curtains partway across the entry. 2. With blowing systems, the single most important factor on face methane dilution is the velocity of the air directed toward the face; a) For the same airflows, use of tubing rather than a curtain usually provides better control of face methane, especially at longer setback distances. 3. With blowing and exhausting systems, and with the mining machine at the face, use of scrubbers increases the amount of intake airflow reaching the mining face; a) Scrubber and spray systems should be designed to achieve efficient face ventilation for the effective removal of gas from the face. 4. Measurement of airflow speed and direction between the curtain and the face helps to predict methane concentrations in the face area; a) In empty entries, airflow velocity is much lower in narrower entries. More airflow should be provided during box cuts to prevent higher methane levels. 5. Regardless of intake flow quantity, increasing scrubber flow will reduce face methane levels if recirculation is controlled. Recirculation can be controlled by; a) Minimizing leakage around the ventilation curtain; b) Directing scrubber exhaust away from the blowing curtain. With exhaust systems the mouth of the curtain should always be outby the scrubber exhaust. 6. Water sprays on the mining machine should be directed to provide the best airflow across the entire face. 7. Methanometer response times can be measured using either of two techniques developed by NIOSH. Instruments with shorter response times more accurately measure current methane levels. Dust cap design has the greatest effect on response times; a) When selecting a methanometer the dust cap design should be examined. The cap should protect the methane sensor from dust and water but not significantly increase the response time. 8. Alternative methane sampling locations on the mining machine should be compared and selected based on the relative protection provided to the face workers. 9. Mine personnel should be provided with methane monitors that can be worn while working in areas that cannot be regularly monitored. Audible, visual, and vibratory alarms for the monitors should be evaluated based on the environment in which the instruments are used. 10. Miners must be safely removed from a mine without exposure to excessive methane following stoppage of a main fan; a) Mines should be evaluated for the most likely area where methane gas can accumulate following stoppage of a main mine fan. 11. In areas between the mouth of the ventilation curtain and the face, airflow direction is constantly changing and it is difficult to accurately measure flow velocity with a single-axis anemometer (e. g., a vane anemometer); a) Following approval for underground use, multi-axis anemometers should be used to monitor airflow direction and velocity between the mouth of the ventilation curtain or tubing and the face. Multi-axis instruments should also be used to monitor flow at locations outby the mining face. 12. During roof bolting, if it is not practical to monitor methane levels at the mining face, methane levels should be measured with a bolter <b>machine-mounted</b> monitor and a detector held 16 ft inby the last row of bolts using a extensible pole.

In response to this recommendation, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Center, initiated the development of a fixed-site <b>machine-mounted</b> continuous respirable dust monitor. The technology chosen for monitor development is the Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc. tapered element oscillating microbalance. Laboratory and in-mine tests have indicated that, with modification, this sensor can meet the humidity and vibration requirements for underground coal mine use. NIOSH is continuing that effort by developing prototypes of a continuous dust monitor based on this technology. These prototypes are being evaluated in underground coal mines as they become available. This effort, conducted as a joint venture with MSHA, is nearing completion with every promise of success.

40|$|On a {{continuous}} miner coal face methane concentrations {{are affected by}} the quantity of fresh intake air reaching the face. When mining the box cut on a 12. 2 -m (40 -ft) two-pass extended cut face, the continuous miner is always at the point of deepest penetration, and operation of the <b>machine-mounted</b> dust scrubber and water spray system improve the flow of fresh air {{to the end of the}} box cut. However, when the continuous miner leaves the box cut to begin cutting the 40 -ft slab, little is known about how much ventilation air reaches the end of the box cut. The Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted a full-scale study to answer this question. Tests were run to determine how much ventilation air reaches the end of the box cut with the continuous miner at three locations in the 40 -fttwo-pass extended cut mining sequence; at the end of the 40 -ft box cut, at the start of the 40 -ft slab cut, and 6. 1 m (20 ft) into the slab cut. During these tests, methane gas was uniformly released at the end of the 40 -ft box cut. Methane concentrations measured 0. 3 m (1 ft) from the roof and face of the box cut were used to estimate face airflow quantities. Fresh air flow rates of 1. 89 and 4. 72 m/sec (4, 000 and 10. 000 cfm), scrubber flow rates of 0, 4, 000 and 10, 000 cfm, water spray pressures of 0 and 3827 kPa (0 and 120 psi), and a blowing curtain setback position of 15. 2 m (50 ft) were used during these tests.
