5000|$|A spiral die is {{the most}} complex {{of the three major}} blown film die types. The polymer melt is evenly {{distributed}} into several feed tubes, which wind around a central mandrel. Each of these feed tubes is connected to the space between the mandrel and outer die walls; the feed tubes gradually diminish in diameter as they spiral around the mandrel. At the same time, the space between the mandrel and outer die walls is increased. This allows the polymer melt to layer and blend, resulting in a uniform melt profile free of weld lines. This die design produces the most uniform films, but is also the most expensive. Air pressure is introduced through the extrusion die so that after the polymer melt leaves the lip of the die, it expands in circumference. The tubing is also drawn along its length faster than it is being extruded. This leads to thinning of the film as it is expanded in both the draw (or machine) direction, and in the transverse (or hoop) direction. The ratio of the blown diameter to the extruded diameter is known as the blow-up ratio, and affects the resulting physical properties of the film, such as stiffness and strength. Film thickness and blow-up ratio can be varied by altering the take-up rate of the rollers, the internal pressure in the blown tube, and the <b>melt</b> <b>extrusion</b> rate.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{strength}} (tau_f) of faults during coseismic slip {{is a major}} {{unknown in}} earthquake mechanics, though it has crucial influence on rupture properties, dynamic stress drop, radiated energy and heat produced during slip. In order to provide constraints on tau_f, High-Velocity Rock Friction Experiments (HVRFE) are conducted on natural rocks with rotary shear apparatuses, reproducing slip (several meters) and slip rate (0. 1 – 3 m s- 1) typical of large earthquakes. Among the various weakening mechanisms possibly activated during seismic slip, we focus on melt lubrication. Solidified, friction-induced melts (pseudotachylytes) decorate some exhumed seismic faults, showing that melt can occur on natural faults, though its frequency is still a matter of debate. In the presence of melt, tau_f undergoes an initial strengthening stage, followed by a dramatic weakening stage (thermal runaway). Field estimates based on pseudotachylyte thickness and experimental measures of tau_f suggest large stress drops once thermal runaway is achieved. These estimates of tau_f are compatible with large dynamic stress drops and high radiation efficiency, as observed for some earthquakes. Moreover, the threshold for the onset of thermal runaway might explain differences between the mechanics of small (M < 4) and large earthquakes.
