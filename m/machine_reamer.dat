50|$|A {{hand reamer}} has a longer taper or lead {{in at the}} front than a <b>machine</b> <b>reamer.</b> This is to {{compensate}} for the difficulty of starting a hole by hand power alone. It also allows the reamer to start straight and reduce the risk of breakage. The flutes may be straight or spiral.|$|E
50|$|A <b>machine</b> <b>reamer</b> {{only has}} a very slight lead in. Because the reamer and work piece are pre-aligned by the machine there is no risk of it {{wandering}} off course. In addition the constant cutting force {{that can be applied}} by the machine ensures that it starts cutting immediately. Spiral flutes have the advantage of clearing the swarf automatically but are also available with straight flutes as the amount of swarf generated during a reaming operation should be very small.|$|E
50|$|The Morse taper {{was invented}} by Stephen A. Morse in the mid-1860s. Since then, it has evolved to {{encompass}} smaller and larger sizes and has been adopted as a standard by numerous organizations, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO 296 and the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) as DIN 228-1. It {{is one of the}} most widely used types, and is particularly common on the shank of taper-shank twist drills and <b>machine</b> <b>reamers,</b> in the spindles of industrial drill presses, and in the tailstocks of lathes.|$|R
50|$|A {{morse taper}} reamer is used {{manually}} to finish morse taper sleeves. These sleeves are a tool {{used to hold}} machine cutting tools or holders in the spindles of machines such as a drill or milling <b>machine.</b> The <b>reamer</b> shown is a finishing reamer. A roughing reamer would have serrations along the flutes {{to break up the}} thicker chips produced by the heavier cutting action used for it.|$|R

United States. 386 F.2d 873, [...] "since {{the early}} days of World War II," [...] the main defense {{agencies}} have been authorized to grant discretionary relief to contractors suffering losses on account of mistakes. The underpinning for the granting of relief must be a finding that such action would facilitate the national defense or prosecution of the war. Title II relief has been referred to variously as [...] "far-reaching," [...] "extraordinary," [...] and [...] "a snare and a delusion." ...|$|R

40|$|A part of {{the drill}} string – the swivel (rotational connector) – accomplishes an {{important}} task in the horizontal drilling. Its malfunctioning {{makes it impossible to}} draw in (install) large diameter and length pipelines. The causes of the connector break-down during the horizontal drilling are investigated in the paper. The drilling has been made for twenty inches gas pipeline installation during reaming operations. A trouble was encountered making good work conditions of a system consisting of the drilling <b>machine</b> drill string <b>reamer</b> swivel tube shield of Cardan joint and the gas pipeline 500 m long. In this case, the swivel brokes down and the planned operation was not finished. The assessment of improper drilling conditions, selection of operation system components, and drilling parameters and the insufficient technological supervising have created an excessive risk of failure. A proper application of technical analysis would considerably decrease the hazard of failure which cause large costs, delays and decrease of confidence to the drilling contractor and pipeline installation...|$|R
