25|$|The early 1970s was a rocky {{time for}} the band, with a {{revolving}} door of musicians; and only the albums Bare Trees and <b>Mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> were successful. Furthermore, a group impersonating Fleetwood Mac (which later became Stretch) was touring the United States with encouragement from the band's manager, Clifford Davis. The tour collapsed, but it led to a protracted lawsuit between Davis and Fleetwood Mac.|$|E
25|$|By early 1971, with Christine Perfect {{becoming}} an official {{member of the}} band, Fleetwood and the group boarded a plane to San Francisco. Spencer, fearful following the recent 1971 San Fernando earthquake, reluctantly boarded the plane. Having arrived in America, he grew more disillusioned with the group, and unsuccessfully pleaded with Fleetwood to cancel this leg of the tour. He left the hotel abruptly one evening, and was found later to have joined Family International, then known as Children of God, a religious group started in 1968 in Huntington Beach, California. Once more, Fleetwood attempted to mediate; however Spencer would not return. After Green was asked to return temporarily to help finish the tour, the band met with Bob Welch who would become their next member. Their next album, Future Games, was released later that year. Bare Trees came a year later, in 1972. During the subsequent tours to promote the latter, Fleetwood once more adopted the role of mediator: Kirwan's self-destructive personality and problems with alcohol culminated in a refusal to go on stage before one concert; Fleetwood himself {{made the decision to}} fire the band member. Furthermore, there were early signs of strife in the marriage of John and Christine McVie. Fleetwood again stepped in to mediate between the two members, talking Christine out of a decision to leave the group. The band added guitarist Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker, formerly of Savoy Brown and Idle Race. The resulting turmoil, however, negatively affected their next album, Penguin, released in 1973 to poor reviews. Walker was subsequently asked to leave the group, and the next album <b>Mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> was received more warmly.|$|E
500|$|Another interpretation, that avoids duality, is the De Broglie–Bohm theory: known also as the pilot-wave model. In that theory, the photon is both, {{wave and}} particle. [...] "This idea {{seems to me}} so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and {{ordinary}} way, {{that it is a}} great <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it was so generally ignored", J.S.Bell.|$|E

5000|$|Kaufman {{says many}} {{share in the}} blame for the mess-the bank's managers, directors, and auditors, as well as banking regulators-but he also wonders how the Pritzkers, as co-owners, could have allowed it to happen. [...] "One of the great <b>mysteries</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is what the Pritzkers were up to, why they took these chances," [...] he said. [...] "It makes no sense given their wealth and visibility." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have never}} told this story, nor shall mortal man see this {{manuscript}} until after I have {{passed over for}} eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do not purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate. Possibly the suggestions which I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down in this chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries of our sister planet; <b>mysteries</b> <b>to</b> you, but no longer <b>mysteries</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{have always}} {{believed}} {{myself to be}} possessed of two souls, one that lives {{on the surface of}} life, pleasing and pleased; the other as deep and as unfathomable as the ocean; a <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and all who know me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{resulting}} representation, {{also called the}} de Broglie–Bohm theory or Bohmian mechanics, the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or quantum potential. [...] "This idea seems to me so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, {{that it is a}} great <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it was so generally ignored", J.S.Bell.|$|E
2500|$|How [...] {{could have}} made a daily {{observation}} of my balcony is still a <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> At the time, the back of my building was not enclosed so anyone could have driven in the back alley to observe my balcony. In addition, my balcony and the back of the apartment complex faced onto a courtyard or back area that was shared with a number of other apartment or office buildings in the area. My balcony could have been seen from dozens of apartments or offices.|$|E
60|$|All {{the while}} Paolo stood by, somehow {{excluded}} from the <b>mystery,</b> talking <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> Faustino. And Il Duro answered easily, as if his mind were disengaged. It was his senses that were absorbed in the sensible life of the plant, and the lime and the cow-dung he handled.|$|R
60|$|We set {{our faces}} towards London, and walked on {{together}} in the first still hour of the new day--I, and this woman, whose name, whose character, whose story, whose objects in life, whose very presence by my side, at that moment, were fathomless <b>mysteries</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It was like a dream. Was I Walter Hartright? Was this the well-known, uneventful road, where holiday people strolled on Sundays? Had I really left, {{little more than an}} hour since, the quiet, decent, conventionally domestic atmosphere of my mother's cottage? I was too bewildered--too conscious also of a vague sense of something like self-reproach--to speak to my strange companion for some minutes. It was her voice again that first broke the silence between us.|$|R

2500|$|The {{subsequent}} tour {{seemed to}} go well, and Penguin was the highest charting Fleetwood Mac album in the US at the time, clawing {{its way into the}} Top 50. However, during the recording of their next album, Mystery to Me; it was mutually agreed upon by the other five members' of the band at that time (Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie, Bob Welch, and Weston) that Walker's vocal style and attitude [...] "did not fit in" [...] with Fleetwood Mac and he was asked to leave in mid-1973; ultimately not featuring on <b>Mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{are heavily}} {{influenced}} by Hell and don't mind admitting it" [...] Andy says with obvious admiration. [...] "The singer even {{taught me how to}} play guitar! We're not a deliberate copycat of Hell in any way though. They were a great band and it's a <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> why they never got anywhere. To be compared to them we don't mind in the least, we would take it more as an honour than anything. We've just done a charity show at Trent Poly dedicated to Hell's guitarist Dave Halliday who committed suicide in January. All the money went to his favourite charity, Cancer Research." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{astonished}} to hear him, but his last words were a <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{will let}} you hear it," [...] she said into the starlit space in a voice of unaccented {{gentleness}} which changed subtly as she went on. [...] "I hope you will never regret that you came out of your friendless <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> King Tom. How many days ago it was! And here is another day gone. Tell me how many more of them there must be? Of these blinding days and nights without a sound." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At last," [...] Hal resumed, [...] "Mrs. Washington {{found out}} the <b>mystery.</b> 'Speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> after dinner, Colonel Hal,' says she. 'Come out to the parade-ground, before the dining-house, and I will tell you all.' I left a half-score of general {{officers}} and brigadiers drinking round the General's table, and found Mrs. Washington waiting for me. She then {{told me it was}} the speech I had made about the box of Marquises, with which the General was offended. 'I should not have heeded it in another,' he had said, 'but I never thought Harry Warrington would have joined against me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I assure you," [...] {{he resumed}} at last, [...] "that {{at that very}} moment the whole <b>mystery</b> was, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as clear as daylight. I only marvelled how his Honour could waste his time and mine by putting what he thought were searching {{questions}} to the accused relating to his past. Francis Smethurst, who had quite shaken off his somnolence, spoke with a curious nasal twang, and with an almost imperceptible soupçon of foreign accent, He calmly denied Kershaw's version of his past; declared that he had never been called Barker, and had certainly never been mixed up in any murder case thirty years ago.|$|R

5000|$|In 1945, he {{attended}} the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco as liaison officer for the Soviet delegation, handling details ranging from transportation to translations. He described it {{as the work of}} [...] "nursemaid, office boy, and messenger." [...] That same year, at the suggestion of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman, he was sent to China, where Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government was fighting Mao Zedong's army, in order to monitor the role of the Soviets in China. He was second secretary and vice consul in Chungking in 1944-1945 and then in the embassy's new location in Nanking in 1946-7, and then second secretary and consul in Nanking in 1947-48. In December 1945, he recorded his assessment of the two sides in his diary: One of the great <b>mysteries</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is why one group of people retains faith, whereas another from much the same origins and experiences loses it. Over the years the Communists have absorbed an incredible amount of punishment, have been guilty of their own share of atrocities, and yet have retained a kind of integrity, faith in their destiny, and the will to prevail. By contrast the Guomindang Nationalists has gone through astonishing tribulations, has committed its excesses, has survived a major war with unbelievable prestige, and is now throwing everything away at a frightening rate, because the revolutionary faith is gone and has been replaced by the smell of corruption and decay.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next day}} two pale-looking men, in artisan costume, {{came up to}} the gate {{at the same time as}} I did, each {{carrying}} a long wooden box under his arm, strongly bound with iron. I tried to make them talk while we were waiting for admission, but neither of them would go beyond [...] "Yes," [...] or [...] "No"; and both had, to my eyes, some unmistakably sinister lines in their faces. The next day the houskeeping cook came to the door--a buxom old woman with a look and a ready smile, and something in her manner which suggested that she had not begun life quite so respectably as she was now ending it. She seemed to be decidedly satisfied with my personal appearance; talked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on indifferent matters with great glibness; but suddenly became silent and diplomatic the moment I looked toward the stair and asked innocently if she had to go up and down them often in the course of the day. As for the doctor himself he was unapproachable on the subject of the mysterious upper regions. If I introduced chemistry in general into the conversation he begged <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> spoil his happy holiday hours with his daughter and me, by leading him back to his work-a-day thoughts. If I referred to his own experiments in particular he always made a joke about being afraid of my chemical knowledge, and of my wishing to anticipate him in his discoveries. In brief, after a week's run of the lower regions, the upper part of the red-brick house and the actual nature of its owner's occupations still remained impenetrable <b>mysteries</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> pry, ponder, and question as I might.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{fortunately}} happened," [...] continued Anselmo, [...] "that I {{had that}} morning saddled {{the best of}} my cream-noses; for on that horse I could say without fear of contradiction, I am on horseback and not on foot. I called him Chingolo, a name which Manuel, also called the Fox, gave him, because he was a young horse of promise, able to fly with his rider. Manuel had nine horses--cream-noses every one--and how from being Manuel's they came to be mine I will tell you. He, poor man, had just lost all his money at cards--perhaps the money he lost was not much, but how he came to have any was a <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> many. <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> however, it was no mystery, and when my cattle were slaughtered and had their hides stripped off by night, perhaps I could have gone to Justice--feeling like a blind man for something in the wrong place--and led her {{in the direction of the}} offender's house; but when one has it in his power to speak, knowing at the same time that his words will fall like a thunderbolt out of a blue sky upon a neighbour's dwelling, consuming it to ashes and killing all within it, why, sirs, in such a case the good Christian prefers to hold his peace. For what has one man more than another that he should put himself in the place of Providence? We are all of flesh. True, some of us are only dog's flesh, fit for nothing; but to all of us the lash is painful, and where it rains blood will sprout. This, I say; but, remember, I say not that Manuel the Fox robbed me--for I would sully no man's reputation, even a robber's, or have anyone suffer on my account.|$|R
60|$|The first {{necessity}} was to {{know something}} of the man. Thus far, {{the true story of}} his life was an impenetrable <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

60|$|The very <b>mystery</b> stung <b>me</b> <b>to</b> interest. As for {{the letter}} itself, it brought me an uplift {{of hope and}} {{inspiration}} such as I would not have believed possible an hour earlier. It rang so truly and sincerely, and the mere thought that somewhere I {{had a friend who}} cared enough to write it, even in such odd fashion, was so sweet that I was half ashamed of the difference it made in my outlook. Sitting there, I took courage and made a compact with myself that I would justify the writer's faith in me--that I would take up my life as something to be worthily lived for all good, to the disregard of my own selfish sorrow and shrinking. I would seek for something to do--for interests which would bind <b>me</b> <b>to</b> my fellow-creatures--for tasks which would lessen the pains and perils of humankind. An hour before, this would not have seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> possible; now it seemed the right and natural thing to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I hae nae <b>mysteries</b> <b>to</b> explain, sir," [...] said Jeanie, [...] "but only to pray you, as {{a preacher}} {{of the gospel}} and a gentleman, <b>to</b> permit <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go safe to the next public-house on the Lunnon road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a blessed}} <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] cried Pycroft, {{scratching}} his head. [...] "Whatever they wanted <b>to</b> bring <b>me</b> {{all the way}} up here for, and then--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you," [...] Mr. Sabin said. [...] "This {{affair of}} Duson's remains a {{complete}} <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I am looking to {{you to help me}} solve it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I swear before God," [...] he said, [...] "this {{is another}} <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> In my worst fears I {{never dreamed of}} such a thing. I would not lay a finger on a sucking infant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wery {{glad to see}} you, Sammy,' {{said the}} elder Mr. Weller, 'though how you've managed to get over your mother-in-law, is a <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I only vish you'd write me out the receipt, that's all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think serious {{investigation}} {{capable of}} dealing with the circumstances," [...] answered the doctor. [...] "Put it in that way, and you put it right. Just look round you. Here we three persons are alive and hearty at this snug table. If (which God forbid!) good Mistress Germaine or yourself were to fall down dead in another moment, I, doctor as I am, could no more explain what first principle of life and movement had been suddenly extinguished in you than the dog there sleeping on the hearth-rug. If I am content to sit down ignorant {{in the face of such}} an impenetrable <b>mystery</b> as this--presented <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> day after day, every time I see a living creature come into the world or go out of it--why may I not sit down content in the face of your lady in the summer-house, and say she's altogether beyond my fathoming, and there is an end of her?" ...|$|R
60|$|I heard, {{not without}} concern, that the {{neighboring}} industry of Lynn was penetrating Salem, {{and that the}} ancient haunt of the witches and the birthplace of our subtlest and somberest wizard was becoming a great shoe-town; but my concern was less for its memories and sensibilities than for an odious duty which I owed that industry, together with all the others in New England. Before I left home I had promised my earliest publisher that I would undertake to edit, or compile, or do something literary to, a work on {{the operation of the}} more distinctive mechanical inventions of our country, which he had conceived the notion of publishing by subscription. He had furnished me, the most immechanical of humankind, with a letter addressed generally to the great mills and factories of the East, entreating their managers <b>to</b> unfold their <b>mysteries</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{for the purposes of this}} volume. His letter had the effect of shutting up some of them like clams, and others it put upon their guard against my researches, lest I should seize the secret of their special inventions and publish it to the world. I could not tell the managers that I was both morally and mentally incapable of this; that they might have explained and demonstrated the properties and functions of their most recondite machinery, and upon examination afterwards found me guiltless of having anything but a few verses of Heine or Tennyson or Longfellow in my head. So I had to suffer in several places from their unjust anxieties, and from my own weariness of their ingenious engines, or else endure the pangs of a bad conscience from ignoring them. As long as I was in Canada I was happy, for there was no industry in Canada that I saw, except that of the peasant girls, in their Evangeline hats and kirtles, tossing the hay in the way-side fields; but when I reached Portland my troubles began. I went with that young minister of whom I have spoken to a large foundry, where they were casting some sort of ironmongery, and inspected the process from a distance beyond any chance spurt of the molten metal, and came away sadly uncertain of putting the rather fine spectacle to any practical use. A manufactory where they did something with coal-oil (which I now heard for the first time called kerosene) refused itself <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I said to myself that probably all the other industries of Portland were as reserved, and I would not seek to explore them; but when I got to Salem, my conscience stirred again. If I knew that there were shoe-shops in Salem, ought not I to go and inspect their processes? This was a question which would not answer itself to my satisfaction, and I had no peace till I learned that I could see shoemaking much better at Lynn, and that Lynn was such a little way from Boston that I could readily run up there, if I did not wish to examine the shoe machinery at once. I promised myself that I would run up from Boston, but in order to do this I must first go to Boston.|$|R
60|$|She {{said that}} {{whatever}} could have possessed her <b>to</b> let <b>me</b> take those poor unfortunate {{children away from}} her, and muddle up everything without her, was a <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> herself.
