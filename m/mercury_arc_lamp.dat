To reduce water costs, process-integrated water treatment and recycling processes are demanded. Annular photoreactors with low and middle-pressure <b>mercury</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> and a solar non concentrating tubular receiver reactor have been applied to examine the treatment of exhaust air washer liquor and its components in the laboratory and up to semi-technical scale. The application of sole UV radiation, the combination of UV radiation with oxidants, semiconductor photocatalysts and the light enhanced Fenton reaction were compared. The photo Fenton conditions were optimized in respect of throughput and hydrogen peroxide consumption. The degradation pathway of epsilon-caprolactam (the main constituent of the air washer liquor) was analyzed by ion chromatography and HPLC-MS. The overall degradation was controlled by total organic carbon analysis. Intermediates like epsilon-amino capronic acid, N-hydroxy-epsilon-caprolactam, epsilon-nitroso capronic acid have been confirmed as initial intermediates also like acetate, oxalate and formiate as intermediates before complete mineralization. In comparison to photolytic hydrogen peroxide oxidation, light enhanced Fenton turned out to be much faster and to consume lower amounts of hydrogen peroxide. It could be demonstrated that the iron catalyst can be recycled with minor activity losses with middle-pressure <b>mercury</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> Photochemically enhanced Fenton reaction has proved to be most effective with respect to the consumption of time, energy and chemicals for the application in exhaust air treatment of nylon finishing. ...|$|R

40|$|Disinfection is {{considered}} to be the primary mechanism for the inactivation/destruction of pathogenic organisms {{to prevent the spread of}} waterborne diseases to downstream users and the environment. It is important that wastewater be adequately treated prior to disinfection in order for any disinfectant to be effective. Some common microorganisms found in domestic wastewater and the diseases associated with them are presented in Table 1. An Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection system transfers electromagnetic energy from a <b>mercury</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> to an organism's genetic material (DNA and RNA). When UV radiation penetrates the cell wall of an organism, it destroys the cell's ability to reproduce. UV radiation, generated by an electrical discharge through mercury vapor, penetrates the genetic material of microorganisms and retards their ability to reproduce. The effectiveness of a UV disinfection system depends on the characteristics of the wastewater, the intensity of UV radiation, the amount of time the microorganisms are exposed to the radiation, and the reactor configuration. For any one treatment plant, disinfection success is directly related to the concentration of colloidal and particulate constituents in the wastewater. The main components of a UV disinfection system are mercury arc lamps, a reactor, and ballasts. The source of UV radiation is either the low-pressure or medium-pressure <b>mercury</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> with low or high intensities...|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{the choice}} of the light source for schlieren {{analysis}} of APPJ, no relevant trends can be found. Thanks to the low luminous intensity of the plasma plume produced by APPJs, there is a wide availability of light sources ranging from monochromatic lasers to broad-band- spectra lamps. As a general indication, on one hand, light sources with a narrow spectral range, such as LED or laser [28, 41 – 47], lead to optimization of the light path because the interaction between radiation and optical components (lens, mirrors, detectors…) is a function of wavelength and leads to noise reduction from the self-luminosity of the plasma plume (for example using green light); on the other hand, high intensity lamps, such as xenon or <b>mercury</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> [48 – 51, 54], characterized by a continuum spectrum, guarantee that a great many photons reach the detector, enhancing the resolution of collected images and allowing the use of high-speed cameras for time-resolved investigation.|$|R

Results showed that the fouling ma-terials were predominantly amorphous inorganics. Fouling material composition was found to be site-specific. Cation composition in the fouling materials was found to be highly complex, with many metals being common to all samples; in all cases, iron, aluminum and calcium were found to represent the ma-jority of the metals present. Predominant anions included carbonate, sulfate, hydroxide, chloride and phosphate. In the absence of UV radiation and heat from UV lamps, the extent of inorganic fouling was substantially diminished.

The illumination profile of the <b>mercury</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> was adjusted to be as homogeneous as possible over the entire field of view (1024 × 1024 pixel). Bleaching during recovery was minimized by closing a shutter in between the acquisition of images. Several prebleaching images were acquired in order to correct for the nonuniform illumination profile. The excitation filter (490 / 20 nm) and the emission filter (528 / 38 nm) were selected for the use of fluorescein. Photobleaching was carried out by a short laser pulse of 30 ms duration provided by an optically pumped solid-state laser (OPSL, Sapphire 488 / 20, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, USA) operated at 488 nm in the TEM 00 -mode which yields a radially symmetric, approximately Gaussian intensity profile. The laser power was set to 90 % of the maximum output power (20 mW). The laser source module is coupled to an optical fiber guiding the laser light to the microscope setup. The beam profile is expanded by coupling of the output fiber coupler to a telescope (beam expander), and thereafter focused close to the back focal plane of the objective (10 ×, NA= 1.2) in order to generate a cylindrically beam shape in the specimen.

40|$|Abstract In {{recent years}} Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) became a {{preferred}} component {{for use in}} microscopy applications. Not only as light sources for transmitted light microscopy but also as excitation light sources for fluorescent microscopy and optogenetics. The advantages of LEDs are the enhanced life-span, the stepless intensity regulation and their switching capability in the μs range. At the same time, semiconductor-based photodetectors gained a foothold {{by the introduction of}} avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and different forms of ´hybrid´ detectors with improved quantum efficiency (QE) as compared to conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Due to these developments it was plausible to ask whether a replacement of the fluorescent light source and detector by an LED and APD combination would decrease the photo-bleaching in experiments with sensitive biological preparations. The central aim of the study was the design and technological development of the optical, electrical and mechanical components for such a replacement on a commercially available microscope system. By using the novel system we made parallel recordings of the intrinsic fluorescence of Nicotinicacid-Adenine-Dinucleotide-Phosphate und Flavin-Adenine-Dinucleotide (NAD(P) H and FAD), in combination with the comparison of different photo-detectors with respect to their sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells and in rat brain slices. First, we monitored photo-bleaching and metabolism dependent recovery of NAD(P) H fluorescence in HEK 293 cells in dependence of available substrates (glucose, 2 -deoxy-glucose and lactate). In order to identify the contribution of astrocytic-neuronal lactate shuttle to energy metabolism, we measured stimulus induced changes in NAD(P) H / FAD fluorescence in hippocampal slices in the presence and absence of lactate transport inhibitors. We have shown that a pulsed LED illumination protocol achieved reduced photobleaching with the same fluorescence yield of FAD as compared to continuous illumination. The empirical optimum of the illumination parameters with our system were 5 Hz and 5 ms with respect to pulse duration and frequency. In all of these experiments LEDs demonstrated a clear benefit in comparison with conventional <b>Mercury</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> LED excitation was of particular advantage for parallel recordings of NAD(P) H and FAD fluorescence in studies of energy metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Fouling of quartz jackets around <b>mercury</b> <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> {{represents}} a performance limitation in ultraviolet (UV) photochemical reactors. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to investigate mechanisms of inorganic fouling at quartz:water interfaces in UV photoreactors. Approaches to the problem include conducting pilot-scale experiments in the laboratory and in the field, numerical simulations of fouling processes, and exploration of physico/chemical treatment to mitigate the quartz fouling problems. Fouling behavior was examined at different observation scales with analytical tools which included UV transmittance measurements, wet chemistry, atomic absorption spectrometry, surface/solid-phase analytical methods, scanning electron microscopy, and microscopic image analyses. ^ Experimental results showed that a broad spectrum of metals that are commonly found in wastewaters was identified in fouling materials. Temporal analyses of fouling materials indicated that fouling was a linear process with time. An increasing trend in longitudinal distributions of fouling material supported the hypothesis that thermally-induced precipitation plays a significant role in inorganic fouling of quartz under conditions of moderate precipitation rate. A second mechanism, impaction of pre-existing particles on quartz surfaces, resulted in heterogeneity in spatial accumulation around quartz jackets. Time-course UV intensity measurements indicated that iron and aluminum-based treatments (e. g., for phosphorous removal) accelerated fouling processes significantly. Fluid shear also played a role in inorganic fouling in that it influenced the agglomeration of coagulated/precipitated particles. Illumination of UV lamps was found to diminish organic accumulation and promote inorganic fouling. ^ A numerical model that accounts mass, heat, and momentum transport characteristics in the immediate vicinity of the quartz:water interface addressed the increasing mixing energy due to velocity gradient inside the momentum boundary layer as approach velocity increases. Thermal effects were illustrated by a temperature field and an increasing saturation excess in the direction of flow. The model also demonstrated that accelerated fouling processes could result in local pH depression (proton production) upon precipitate formation. Altogether, the mathematical model was found to be capable of explaining fouling behavior observed in the pilot-scale experiments qualitatively and providing insights into fouling mechanisms. ^ Several physico/chemical strategies were reviewed for reducing quartz fouling. Methods of UV system treatments are recommended based on the results and findings of this research. ...|$|R
