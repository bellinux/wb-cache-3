500|$|Previous {{definitions}} of chemical quantity involved Avogadro's number, a historical term {{closely related to}} the Avogadro constant, but defined differently: Avogadro's number was initially defined by Jean Baptiste Perrin as the number of atoms in one gram-molecule of atomic hydrogen, meaning one gram of hydrogen. This number is also known as Loschmidt constant in German literature. The constant was later redefined as the number of atoms in 12 grams of the isotope carbon-12 (12C), and still later generalized to relate amounts of a substance to their molecular weight. [...] For instance, to a first approximation, 1 gram of hydrogen element (H), having the atomic (mass) number 1, has [...] hydrogen atoms.
