These ChLCP behave both as thermotropic and lyotropic, confering interesting macromolecular properties indicative of potential application on the biomedical and engineering field. They have {{shown to be}} biocompatible against macrophages and fibroblasts cellular lines, and able to interact with biomacromolecules such as lipids (both neutral and cationi) and nucleic acids, the structures of the complexes being identified by synchrotron radiation source 3, 4, 5. Cationic liposomial/surfactant systems based on our CLCP were developed which entrapped DNA plasmids, acting as non viral cationic vectors for gene therapy, which successfully transfected in several tumor cell lines 6, 7. Cationic functionalized ChLCP have been synthesized, dispersed in TAE (0, 04 M TRIS; 0, 001 M EDTA) and complexed directly with commercial DNA of increasing complexity: [Poly-A]; [Poly-C]; [Poly-G]; [PolydT]; [PolyC-PolyG]; [PolyAC-PolydT]; commercial calf thymus DNA and plasmid. Three different proportions ChLCP:DNA were prepared: (1 : 2), (1 : 1), and (2 : 1) respectively by mixing and digesting for 12 h in a swinging shaker. Neutron scattering experiments, had shown sufficient contrast (scattering length density difference) between new cholesteric PTOBEE-Ammonium (1. 5 to 1. 9 x 1010 /cm 2) and polynucleotide [PolyC-PolyG] (3. 32 x 1010 /cm 2) for contrast variation SANS experiments. This experiment was successfully performed at NIST 8. The structure of the cationic complexes has been studied by SAXS at the BM 16 beamline at ESRF, at room temperature. A monochromatized beam at = 0, 9795 Å was used. Two-dimensional data recorded by an image-plate detector was placed at 5975 cm from the sample.

Users can make subdirectories here as well, allowing for custom organization. For example, if a masked package had multiple masked dependencies, the user could make a directory with the name of the original masked package, and put all the <b>mask</b> <b>files</b> for the package and its dependencies in that directory.

Moved to Jenkinson's Mean Framewise Displacement (Mean FD) calculation for MeanFD-related measures. Made the output file structure for SCA outputs more clear. Changed the working directory structure for group analysis so that it is more clear.

40|$|DNA microarrays are {{powerful}} tools for comparing gene expression profiles from closely related organisms. However, a single microarray design is frequently {{used in these}} studies. Therefore, the levels of certain transcripts can be grossly underestimated due to sequence differences between the transcripts and the arrayed DNA probes. Here, we seek to improve the sensitivity and specificity of oligonucleotide microarray-based gene expression analysis by using genomic sequence information to predict the hybridization efficiency of orthologous transcripts to a given microarray. To test our approach, we examine hybridization patterns from three Escherichia coli strains on E. coli K- 12 MG 1655 gene expression microarrays. We create electronic <b>mask</b> <b>files</b> to discard data from probes predicted to have poor hybridization sensitivity and specificity to cDNA targets from each strain.

40|$|Microaggregation is an anonymization {{technique}} consisting on partitioning {{the data}} into clusters no smaller than k elements and then replacing the whole cluster by its prototypical representant.

The goal is to build a generalized description satisfied by at least k domain objects and to replace these domain objects by the description.

NEW:- Version 1. 2 -a. bug fixed: the code was not checking the drizzling kernel used by the reference image, and was thus using whatever kernel the user had defined in its drizzle preference file. The fix allows the code to drizzle with the same kernel used in the reference image. b.

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze x ray data, {{it is nearly}} always {{necessary}} to extract source and background events from a data set. Typically, this is done by defining geometric spatial regions of the data set to describe the source and background. For example, one might wish to extract source events from a circular or elliptical region centered at a particular pixel, and background events from a circular or elliptical annulus whose inner radius matches the source region. At the same time, it might be necessary to exclude one or more nearby sources from the source or background region in question. Thus, it might be necessary to define a pie-shaped region or even an entirely irregularly-shaped region to exclude. A spatial filtering scheme called REGIONS was implemented in IRAF/PROS to support these {{and other types of}} spatial region extraction. It allows users to create a spatial mask by specifying one or more ASCII geometric shape descriptors (box, circle, ellipse, pie, point, annulus, and polygon) as regions to be included or excluded in the mask. In addition, two or more shapes can be combined using Boolean algebra to create an infinite variety of sophisticated regions. Each geometric shape has a specific set of parameters that describe that shape. For example, a circle is described by a center and a radius, while a box is described by a center, length, width, and rotation angle. These quantities can be specified in units of pixels or, in cases where the target image contains world coordinate system information, they can be described in units such as RA and Dec. Users can create region <b>mask</b> <b>files</b> by feeding an ASCII region descriptor to the IRAF/PROS plcreate task. Temporary masks can also be created from ASCII region descriptors by individual applications that call the routines in the region creation library. This library implements a yacc-based region parser that compiles the ASCII descriptors into 'software CPU' instructions which are then executed to create the mask. The mask created from these region descriptors is a standard IRAF PLIO mask. It can be combined with other PLIO masks (e. g., exposure masks) to provide complete spatial filtering capabilities. The capabilities of the region filtering scheme are described. It also discusses the design philosophy guiding our work, as well as our plans for the future...|$|R

Though this inhibits potential intruders from directly identifying a respondent, an additional confidentiality concern stems from the presence of non-confidential public use data files in which direct identifiers have not been removed. If statistical techniques can be used to link a public use data record to a released data record, an intruder may be able to identify a respondent 2 ̆ 7 s confidential attributes.
