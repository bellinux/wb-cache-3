60|$|He {{could hardly}} have chosen a worse formula. The {{question}} has on most people precisely the same effect as that which the query, 'Do {{you know where you}} lost it?' has on one who is engaged in looking for <b>mislaid</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{rights of}} a finder of such {{property}} are determined {{in part by the}} status in which it is found. Because these classifications have developed under the common law of England, they turn on nuanced distinctions. The general rule attaching to the three types of property may be summarized as: A finder of property acquires no rights in <b>mislaid</b> <b>property,</b> is entitled to possession of lost property against everyone except the true owner, and is entitled to keep abandoned property. This rule varies by jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|Treasure trove is {{property}} {{that consists of}} coins or currency hidden by the owner. To be considered treasure trove and not <b>mislaid</b> <b>property,</b> the property must have been deliberately hidden or concealed, and sufficiently long ago that the original owner can be considered dead or not discoverable. For example, under English law, one hundred Roman coins found buried in a chest would be treasure trove; however, one hundred Roman coins which were lost over time in a marketplace would not be treasure trove, as they were not deliberately hidden as a single hoard.|$|E
50|$|Corliss v. Wenner, 34 P.3d 1100 (Idaho 2001), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Court of Appeals of Idaho that {{rejected}} the common law distinctions between lost, <b>mislaid,</b> and abandoned <b>property</b> and treasure trove.|$|R
50|$|Lost, <b>mislaid,</b> and {{abandoned}} <b>property</b> are {{categories of the}} common law of property which deals with personal property or chattel which has left the possession of its rightful owner without having directly entered the possession of another person. Property can be considered lost, mislaid or abandoned depending on {{the circumstances under which}} it is found by the next party who obtains its possession.|$|R
50|$|Bona vacantia was {{inherited}} from English Common Law and {{continues in the}} form of lost, <b>mislaid,</b> and abandoned <b>property,</b> applied only to personal property that has left the owner's possession, as opposed to an estate left in intestacy after death. Intangible personal assets such as checks, account balances, and securities are under unclaimed property law, varying by state. The states do not take permanent possession, but act as the custodian of the property in perpetuity on behalf of the rightful owner.|$|R
40|$|No. The {{property}} {{should not}} be considered <b>mislaid</b> <b>property.</b> <b>Mislaid</b> <b>property,</b> to which Paset as finder would not acquire any rights, is property that isintentionslly put in a certain place and later forgotten. Lost property, which gains the finder the right of possession against everyone but the true owner, is property that is unintentionally separated from the owner's domain. The failure of anyone to come forward and claim the money despite the bank's notice to all {{who had been in the}} vault, was evidence that the property had not been mislaid. The bank's contention that since the vault was under its control and access to it was limited, property could not be lost in such a public-limited area was also rejected...|$|E
2500|$|Property law, {{admiralty}} {{law and the}} law of the sea may be of relevance when lost, <b>mislaid,</b> and abandoned <b>property</b> is found at sea. Salvage law rewards salvors for risking life and property to rescue the property of another from peril. On land the distinction between deliberate and accidental loss led to the concept of a [...] "treasure trove". In the United Kingdom, shipwrecked goods should be reported to a Receiver of Wreck, and if identifiable, they should be returned to their rightful owner.|$|R
