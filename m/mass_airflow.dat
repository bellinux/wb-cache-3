25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve). Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} software (Fluent) {{was used to}} successfully model non-uniform airflow through large grain storage silos using Ergun’s equation, which can account for material properties of a grain mass such as porosity and fines concentration. Three example applications were investigated: a peaked grain mass, a grain mass with a high fines concentration core, and a grain mass aerated from a ring duct around {{the bottom of the}} silo wall. The velocity magnitude through a peaked grain mass decreased from 0. 0163 m/s at the air inlet to less than 0. 008 m/s at 1. 0 m below the peak of the grain mass. The velocity magnitude in a core of high fine material concentration decreased from 0. 0142 m/s at the air inlet to 0. 008 m/s, which resulted in a 40 % lower effective airflow rate through the grain core versus the rest of the grain <b>mass.</b> This non-uniform <b>airflow</b> behavior confirmed the observation by practitioners that moving a cooling front through peaked grain or a core with high fines concentration takes substantially longer than through a leveled and/ or cored grain mass.

50|$|The primary factor used in {{determining}} the amount of fuel required by the engine is the amount (by weight) of air that is being taken in by the engine for use in combustion. Modern systems use a <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> sensor to send this information to the engine control unit.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} where a <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> sensor (MAF) is used and is located {{upstream}} from the blowoff valve, the engine control unit (ECU) will inject excess fuel because the atmospherically vented air is not subtracted from the intake charge measurements.

40|$|ABSTRACT Guidelines {{recommend}} defining chronic obstructive {{pulmonary disease}} (COPD) by airflow obstruction and other factors, but no studies have evaluated {{the ability of}} existing multicomponent indices to predict mortality up to 10 years. We conducted a patient-based pooled analysis. Survival analysis and C statistics were used to determine the best COPD index/indices according to several construct variables and by varying time-points. Individual data of 3633 patients from 11 COPD cohorts were collected, totalling the experience of 15 878 person-years. Overall, there were 1245 death events within our cohorts, with a Kaplan–Meier survival of 0. 963 at 6 months, which was reduced to 0. 432 at 10 years. In all patients, ADO (age, dyspnoea and forced expiratory volume in 1 s), BODE (body <b>mass</b> index, <b>airflow</b> obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise capacity) and e-BODE (BODE plus exacerbations) were the best indices to predict 6 -month mortality.

Patients and methods: We performed a post hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study that included subjects with stable COPD. Sociodemographic and clinical information was recorded using the Body <b>mass</b> index, <b>airflow</b> Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exacerbations index and the Charlson comorbidity index. Cognitive performance was studied by the mini-mental state examination, with a score less than 27 indicating clinical impairment. Depressive symptoms, physical activity, and quality of life (EuroQoL- 5 dimensions and COPD Assessment Test) were also evaluated. Results: The analysis included 940 subjects. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 39. 4 %. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that cognitive impairment was associated with educational level (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 096, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 011 – 0. 447) and poorer quality of life measured by the EuroQoL- 5 dimensions social tariff (OR = 0. 967, 95 % CI = 0. 950 – 0. 983). When questionnaires {{were not included in the}} analysis, cognitive impairment was associated with educational level (OR = 0. 063, 95 % CI = 0. 010 – 0. 934), number of exacerbations (OR = 11. 070, 95 % CI = 1. 450 – 84. 534), Body <b>mass</b> index, <b>airflow</b> Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exacerbations index score (OR = 1. 261, 95 % CI = 1. 049 – 1. 515), and the Charlson comorbidity index (OR = 1. 412, 95 % CI = 1. 118 – 1. 783).

We also compared the predictive value of IC/TLC with that of the BODE (body <b>mass</b> index, <b>airflow</b> obstruction, dyspnea, exercise performance) Index. Subjects who died (183; 27 %) were older; had lower body mass index, FEV 1, and IC/TLC ratio; walked less in the 6 -minute walking distance; and had more dyspnea, a higher BODE Index, and comorbidity (p 0. 001). On the basis of logistic regression analysis, IC/TLC was found to be a good and independent predictor of all-cause and respiratory mortality. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic Type II curves, IC/TLC compared favorably with FEV 1 and predicted mortality indepen-dently of the BODE Index.

50|$|A {{hot wire}} <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> sensor determines {{the mass of}} air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of the hot wire <b>mass</b> <b>airflow</b> sensor {{is similar to that}} of the hot wire anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over the wire or a constant current through the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|E

We also aimed to identify preoperative predictors of {{improvement in the}} BODE index. MethodsIn a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing lung-volume reduction surgery at our center, with the methodology of the National Emphysema Treatment Trial, we compared clinical characteristics before and 1 year after surgery with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Changes in the BODE index were correlated with preoperative variables with the Spearman correlation coefficient. ResultsTwenty-three patients with predominantly upper-lobe pulmonary emphysema underwent lung-volume reduction surgery (14 by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, 9 by median sternotomy). There were no postoperative or follow-up deaths. The BODE index improved from a median of 5 (interquartile range 4 - 5) before surgery to 3 (interquartile range 2 - 4) 1 year after surgery (P <. 0001). Improvements were seen in the lung function and dyspnea components of the BODE index. Lower preoperative 6 -minute walk distance and lower postwalk Borg fatigue scores were each associated with greater improvement in the BODE index after 1 year.

For each patient, body <b>mass</b> index, <b>airflow</b> obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity were measured and converted into the BODE index before treatment and at one and three months after initiation of treatment.
