Some experiments have shown that hydrogen consumption by SRB or hydrogenase increased the corrosion rate of mild steel. This was observed only in the presence of phosphate species. Here the cathodic behaviour of phosphate species on steel was studied to elucidate the role of phosphate in anaerobic corrosion of steel. Results showed: a linear correlation between reduction waves in linear voltammetry and phosphate concentration at a constant pH value; that phosphate ions induced considerable anaerobic corrosion of mild steel, which was sensitive to hydrogen concentration in the solution; and that the corrosion potential of stainless steel in presence of phosphate was shifted to more negative values as molecular hydrogen was added to the atmosphere in the reaction vessel. Phosphate species, and possibly other weak acids present in biofilms, are suggested to play an important role in the anaerobic corrosion of steels via a reversible mechanism of electrochemical deprotonation that may be accelerated by hydrogen removal...|$|R

Steel {{structures in the}} Duluth-Superior harbor show unusual patterns of corrosion characterized by raised blister-like nodules called tubercles and pitted steel. This corrosion phenomenon could possibly decrease the integrity and the lifespan of the structures. Microbiological and chemical factors that may be influencing corrosion processes were {{examined in this study}} from 2007 - 2009. A laboratory microcosm experiment was designed to examine several microbiology and water quality parameters. Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses showed that bacterial communities on steel were different from one another in microcosm treatments with different types of water (e. g. autoclaved Duluth-Superior harbor water vs. unaltered Duluth-Superior harbor water and Lake Superior water vs. Duluth-Superior harbor water). Coupons with different bacterial communities also showed differences in sulfate-reducing bacterial abundance and iron-oxidizing bacterial abundance. Further, coupons with higher abundances of sulfate-reducing bacteria and iron-oxidizing bacteria had higher inverse polarization resistance values. Inverse polarization resistance is frequently used to approximate the instantaneous rate of corrosion. Mass lost and pit depth were measured on steel in the microcosm, and these two measurements showed a positive correlation. <b>Microbiological</b> and <b>corrosion</b> measurements were also performed on steel in the Duluth-Superior harbor, and these measurements were compared to steel in the microcosm experiment.

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is impacted by important economic losses due to corrosion problem. As part of this problem, microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) is still a subject of research. The most often evoked and well acknowledge MIC mechanism is linked to sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). However, some studies have shown that MIC can occur even when SRB is not present in the corroding environment; in this framework, the main objective of the thesis is to provide new insights on corrosion of carbon steel caused by other mechanisms different to those described with SRB. First, the influence of an electroactive strain, G. sulfurreducens (an iron reducing bacteria, IRB) on the corrosion/protection of steel C 1145 was studied. When phosphate species are present in the medium, bacteria promote the formation of an iron phosphate layer (vivianite) that afterwards protects the material. In presence of NH 4 +, corrosion rates are higher but bacteria decrease the dissolution of the material. In the second part, field samples from pigging operations performed in water injection pipelines were analysed from <b>microbiological</b> and electrochemical <b>corrosion</b> points of view. Molecular analysis and identification of the biofilm community show the presence of sulfidogenic species besides SRB.

40|$|Longer term {{exposure}} of mild steel in natural (biotic) waters progresses as a bimodal function of time, both for corrosion mass loss and for pit depth. Recent test results, however, found this also for immersion in clean fresh, almost pure and triply distilled waters. This shows chlorides or microbiological activity {{is not essential}} for the electrochemical processes producing bimodal behaviour. It is proposed that the first mode is aerobic corrosion that eventually produces a non-homogeneous corroded surface and rust coverage sufficient to allow formation of anoxic niches. Within these, aggressive autocatalytic reduction then occurs under anoxic abiotic conditions, caused by sulfide species originating from the MnS inclusions typical in steels. This is consistent with Wranglen's model for abiotic anoxic crevice and pitting corrosion without external aggressive ions. In biotic conditions, metabolites from anaerobic bacterial activity within and near the anoxic niches provides additional (sulfide) species {{to contribute to the}} severity of corrosion. Limited observational evidence that supports this hypothesis is given but further investigation is required to determine all contributor(s) to the cathodic current for the electrochemical reaction.

Three time exposures of 1 month, 6 months and 1 year were conducted. Corrosion products were identified via Raman spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive x-ray system. Corrosion rates were calculated based on mass loss data obtained {{at the end of}} the 6 month and 1 year exposure periods. Microorganism contamination was identified based on molecular biology techniques such as colony polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. pH, total acid number, and dissolved oxygen were also measured in the fuel and water layers of the ultra-pure water-fuel mixtures.

Organic carbon (OC) influences the interaction and transport of many toxic organic or inorganic chemicals found in the nature. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate how the different factors such as the raw water source and the material in the networks influence the concentration of OC in the loose deposits. An OC isolation method for lake sediments was adapted to determine nonpurgeable organic carbon (NPOC) in the loose deposits. The average NPOC amount in deposit samples collected from DS supplied with groundwater varied from 0. 18 mg/g to 21. 01 mg/g. In the samples collected from DS supplied with surface water NPOC ranged from 1. 21 to 18. 99 mg/g. In samples collected from different drinking water reservoirs in Latvia, NPOC ranged from 0. 20 to 3. 11 mg/g. The pipe material was a single the only important factor influencing the concentration of organic carbon in loose deposits. The smallest average NPOC amount was found in the samples from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes (0. 48 mg/g of deposits), while the largest NPOC amount was found in polyethylene (PE) pipes (14. 29 mg/g). Samples collected from cast iron (CI) pipes contained 4. 64 mg/g. Iron was found to be the dominant material in sediments, followed by silica and aluminum.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  7, {{the amount of}} the {{research}} items on corrosion continuously increased from 1994 to 2013, but decreased a little bit in 2012. “Corrosion” {{was one of the most}} important research directions on electrochemical technology for water and wastewater treatment, which were mainly focused on pitting corrosion, localized corrosion, atmospheric corrosion, corrosion protection, corrosion resistance, and corrosion inhibition. Pitting corrosion (Frankel 1998) which belonged to localized corrosion accelerated the dissolution of metal when the otherwise protective passive film on metal surface was broken down. Moreover, researchers had paid more concern on the effects of alloy composition (Williams et al. 2010), environment (Jafarian et al. 2008), potential (Lee et al. 2011), and temperature (Lee et al. 2010). Atmospheric corrosion which was a new scientific focus on the corrosion process had been studied by engineers for nearly a century. Leygraf and Graedel (2000) firstly comprehensively described the corrosion on structures and materials, and properly used latest scientific tools to prevent or minimize the corrosion damage. Therefore, corrosion protection, corrosion resistance, and corrosion inhibition had appeared in anticorrosion field for the prevention of different metals and alloys, which was achieved by specific coatings or composite films on their surface. Besides, nano-structured surface treatment coatings was widely used in the manufacture of the specific coatings or composite films, such as, tantalum oxide nano-particle coatings (Shen et al. 2005; Díaz et al. 2013), nano-siloxane epoxy coating (Bagherzadeh et al. 2012), and nano-structured polymeric coatings (Aglan et al. 2007).

40|$|This report {{examines}} the degradation modes of four Ni-Cr-Mo alloys under conditions {{relevant to the}} Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project (YMP). The materials considered are Alloys C- 276, C- 4, C- 22, and 625 because they have desirable characteristics for the conceptual design (CD) of the high-level radioactive-waste containers presented in the YMP Site Characterization Plan (SCP). The types of degradation covered in this report are general corrosion; localized corrosion, including pitting and crevice corrosion; stress corrosion cracking in chloride environments; hydrogen embrittlement (HE); and undesirable phase transformations {{due to a lack}} of phase stability. Topics not specifically addressed are welding concerns and <b>microbiological</b> <b>corrosion.</b> The four Ni-Cr-Mo alloys have excellent corrosion resistance in chloride environments such as seawater as well as in more aggressive environments. They have significantly better corrosion resistance than the six materials considered for the CD waste container in the YMP SCP.

In seawater, the Ni-Cr-Mo alloys have negligible general corrosion rates and show little evidence of localized corrosion. The four base materials of these alloys are expected to have nearly indistinguishable corrosion resistance in the YMP environments. The strength requirements of the SCP-CD waste container are met by these materials in the annealed condition; in this condition, they are highly resistant to HE.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{corrosion}} prevention is successfully achieved by proper selection of materials and inhibitors, by acting on the environment, and by using cathodic or anodic protection, but it is mainly achieved by a proper design that starts from scratch and fundamentals. The level of knowledge is essential and two approaches can be devised. One approach makes use of highly resistant materials, and high thicknesses, redundancies and a program of maintenance are adopted. This requires large capital investments and it is the only feasible approach in situations of "absence of knowledge", where the main resources are materials and energy. The second approach relies on information, and the knowledge of a phenomenological model of the degradation related to historical data. Critical situations are avoided at the design stage in terms of both degradation and recovery, by using inexpensive materials and protecting them if necessary. It consists in scheduled inspection programs for driving the maintenance program and updating the phenomenological model. This way requires a rational use of the resource "information" but it can bring to significant savings of the "materials" and "energy" resources. During the installation phase, the mechanical deformations necessary to make connections, the welding and drilling operations may lead to changes in material microstructure, internal stresses and damage of the coatings. In the case of concrete the distribution of reinforcing bars can lead to an uneven compaction of the concrete, and the use of spacers may allow the use of the desired thickness of the concrete cover. The hydraulic test of the equipment is often made with untreated water that, if not carefully removed at the end, can lead to <b>microbiological</b> <b>corrosion</b> problems. In the start-up phase, and especially where the movement of fluids is markedly different from that during service life can lead to phenomena of sedimentation and localized corrosion. During the service life, the operating conditions may change both for the degradation of the plant itself and for modifications of the treated fluids, the environmental conditions, the operating targets, etc. During the plant shutdowns a problem that can arise is whether or not, and how, to empty the plant and the answer depends on the properties of the materials used. Several good practice rules can be adopted in the design stage. It is important to avoid water stagnation and infiltration by using correct geometries and drainages, and to prevent condensation, caused by thermal bridges and indoors environments. The crevices caused by welding spots and unwanted deposits must be avoided. As well as the percolation of a material on another in the case that the products of atmospheric corrosion of the first material can act as cathodic sites for the corrosion of the second one. Check the galvanic coupling between different materials and, if the coupling is unwanted, use insulating joints or materials with intermediate properties or interpose parts that are easily replaced. Avoid situations that make difficult the maintenance operations and the hydrodynamic conditions that can enhance corrosion phenomena. Consider the galvanic coupling between metallic materials placed in different environments...|$|E
