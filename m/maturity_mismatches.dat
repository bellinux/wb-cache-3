40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} a new discord in the Austrian {{economic}} theory {{about the effects}} of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatching</b> practiced by banks on the shape of the yield curve and defines the not yet established concept of the natural yield curve. The conflicting contributions of Austrian authors are compared for that purpose. Based on this comparison, a coherent theory of the effects of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatching</b> is presented in a framework of the loanable funds market. A definition of the natural yield curve is then produced by a synthesis of the above-mentioned findings and the Austrian theory of the natural rate of interest.

50|$|A {{maturity}} mismatch generally {{refers to the}} difference between the maturities of a company's assets and liabilities. A {{maturity mismatch}} affects a company's ability to survive a period of stress that may limit its access to funding and to withstand shocks in the yield curve. For example, if a company relies on short-term funding to finance longer-term positions, it will be subject to significant refunding risk that may force it to sell assets at low market prices or potentially suffer through significant margin pressure. However, <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches</b> are not confined to the use of short-term liabilities and can exist at any point in the maturity schedule of a nonbank financial company's assets and liabilities.|$|E
50|$|One {{reason may}} be <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches.</b> For instance, suppose a company is earning 5% on an asset {{supporting}} a liability on which it is paying 3.5%. The asset matures in three years while the liability matures in ten. In three years, the firm will have to reinvest the proceeds from the asset. If interest rates decrease, it could end up reinvesting at 3%. For the remaining seven years, it would earn 3% on the new asset while continuing to pay 3.5% on the original liability. Repricing risk also occurs with floating rate assets or liabilities. If fixed rate assets are financed with floating rate liabilities, the rate payable on the liabilities may rise while the rate earned on the assets remains constant.|$|E

40|$|Output {{growth in}} {{emerging}} markets is significantly more volatile than in advanced economies, {{due in large}} part to fluctuations in total factor productivity (TFP). This paper shows that where <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> is widespread, as in emerging markets, capital flow volatility amplifies the volatility of both output and TFP. I build a model of a small open economy in which financial frictions force firms to fund long-term projects with short-term debt. Greater uncertainty regarding the future availability of foreign borrowing causes firms to cut long-term investment. This depresses aggregate investment and generates an endogenous drop in aggregate productivity. Conversely, a fall in uncertainty increases investment, output, and TFP. Shocks to capital flow volatility will therefore amplify the volatility of output and TFP in emerging markets where <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> is pervasive, but not in advanced economies. Using data from a panel of major emerging markets, I show that the volatility of portfolio debt flows negatively affects output by dampening investment, while the volatility of equity flows, which do not generate <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch,</b> has no effect. Moreover I find that the negative impact of volatility is mitigated by financial market development, which I use as a proxy for the extent of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> in the economy. These empirical results suggest that <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> acts as an important channel through which uncertainty shocks affect the real economy.

We measure the risk of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> by estimating, at the firm level, the effect on investment of the interaction of short-term exposure and aggregate capital flight. This effect is (statistically) zero, contrary to the prediction of the maturity-mismatch hypothesis. This conclusion is robust to using a variety of different estimators, alternative measures of capital flows, and controls for devaluation effects and access to international capital. We do find evidence that short-term-exposed firms pay higher financing costs, and have lower equity valuations, but not that this reduction in net worth translates into a drop in investment or sales. <b>Maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> Investment Financial crises...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{large and}} growing {{theoretical}} literature on how currency and <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches</b> affect firms’balance sheets and the overall level of economic activity. The main point in the literature is that a real devaluation increases the domestic currency value of dollar debt and by weakening firms ’ balance sheets prevents them from increasing production or investing 1. Another channel through which devaluations may have contractionary effects {{is the cost of}} imported inputs (Obstfled, 2001, Reif, 2001). For the above reasons, the expansionary effect of devaluation that is generated within standard Mundell-Fleming models is either attenuated or completely eliminated yielding to a situation in which devaluations are contractionary. While some authors like Cespedes et al. (2000), show that the standard Mundell-Fleming result holds even in the presence of currency mismatches, others (Aghion et al., 2001) point out that if the balance–sheet effect is large enough devaluation can be contractionary. At the same time, Reif (2001) builds a model in which, even {{in the presence of a}} healthy financial system, currency crises may occur as the outcome of self-fulfilling contractionary devaluations and the key transmission mechanism is the price of imported inputs 2. While the theoretical literature mostly emphasized currency mismatches, <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches</b> are also important because defense of a pegged exchange rate may lead to high real interest rates that are likely to harm firms that have short-term domestic currency debt. It has been argued that countries in which firms are characterized by large currency mismatches tend to exhibit a fear of floating and hence heavily manage the exchange rate (Calvo and Reinhart, 2002, Hausmann et al., 2001). At the same time, countries in which firms have large <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches</b> are more willing to let the exchange rate float more freely and avoid the high real interest rates associated with a defense of the exchange rate. Therefore, the presence and magnitude of currency and <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches</b> plays a determinant role in the assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of different exchange rate regimes...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} international capital flows on small open economies from a theoretical and empirical perspective. The �first chapter shows that where <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> is widespread, as in emerging markets, greater capital flow volatility negatively affects investment, output, and aggregate productivity. I build {{a model of a}} small open economy in which �financial frictions force �firms to engage in <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch,</b> funding long-term projects with short-term debt. Greater uncertainty regarding the future availability of foreign borrowing causes �firms to cut long-term investment, depressing aggregate investment and generating an endogenous drop in aggregate productivity. The second chapter {{examines the}} relationship between capital flow volatility and economic performance using unique monthly frequency data set on international capital flows. I show that it is specifically the volatility of portfolio debt flows that negatively affects investment. Using �financial development as a proxy for the extent of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> in the economy, I �find that the negative impact of debt flows is smaller where financial markets are more developed. Finally, I use industry-level data to show capital flow volatility depresses investment more in industries with longer average time-to-build. These �findings are consistent with a role for <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> in transmitting volatility shocks. The third chapter studies episodes of large capital in flows. These events are typically followed by an economic downturn and a reallocation of labor and capital into the nontradables sector. The extent of labor reallocation is significantly related to the depth and length of the post-episode downturn. We interpret our results using a model of a two sector economy, showing that capital in flows episodes generated by a fall in international interest rates or a rise in future productivity will push labor into the notradables sector. In flows caused by a productivity increase that has already occurred shift labor into tradables production. Allocation of labor therefore provides information on the underlying shock driving the capital inflows...|$|R
