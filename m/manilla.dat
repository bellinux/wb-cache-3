25|$|Sometimes {{distinguished}} from <b>manillas</b> mainly by their wearability {{are a large}} number of regional types called 'Bracelet' monies and 'Legband' monies. Some are fairly uniform in size and weight and served as monies of account like <b>manillas,</b> but others were actually worn as wealth display. The less well off would mimic the movements of the 'better off' who were so encumbered by the weight of <b>manillas</b> that they moved in a very characteristic way. The larger <b>manillas</b> had a much more open shape.|$|R

25|$|<b>Manillas</b> {{bear some}} {{resemblance}} to torcs or torques in being rigid and circular and open-ended at the front. (The word 'torc' comes from Latin 'torquere', 'to twist', {{because of the}} twisted shape of the collar, an occasional feature of <b>manillas.)</b> Although torcs were most often neck-rings, there were also bracelets with this shape. Torcs were made from gold or bronze, less often silver.|$|R

25|$|Internally, manillas {{were the}} first true {{general-purpose}} currency known in West Africa, being used for ordinary market purchases, bride price, payment of fines, compensation of diviners, and {{for the needs of}} the next world, as burial money. Cowrie shells, imported from Melanesia and valued at a small fraction of a <b>manilla,</b> were used for small purchases. In regions outside coastal west Africa and the Niger river a variety of other currencies, such as bracelets of more complex native design, iron units often derived from tools, copper rods, themselves often bent into bracelets, and the well-known Handa (Katanga cross) all served as special-purpose monies. As the slave trade wound down in the 19th century so did <b>manilla</b> production, which was already becoming unprofitable. By the 1890s their use in the export economy centered around the palm-oil trade. Many manillas were melted down by African craftsmen to produce artworks. Manillas were often hung over a grave to show the wealth of the deceased and in the Degema area of Benin some women still wear large manillas around their necks at funerals, which are later laid on the family shrine. Gold manillas are said to have been made for the very important and powerful, such as King Jaja of Opobo in 1891.|$|E

25|$|Some sources {{attribute}} their {{introduction to}} the ancient Phoenicians who traded along {{the west coast of}} Africa or even early Carthaginian explorers and traders. The Egyptians have also been suggested as they used penannular money. One interesting suggestion is that Nigerian fishermen brought them up in their nets from the shipwrecks of European wrecks or made them from the copper 'pins' used in wooden sailing ships wrecked in the Bight of Benin. One theory is that if indigenous, they copied a splayed-end Raffia cloth bracelet worn by women, another that the well-known Yoruba Mondua with its bulbous ends inspired the <b>manilla</b> shape.|$|E

25|$|<b>Manillas</b> are {{a form of}} money, {{usually made}} of bronze or copper, which were used in West Africa. They were {{produced}} in large numbers {{in a wide range}} of designs, sizes, and weights. Originating before the colonial period, perhaps as the result of trade with the Portuguese Empire, <b>Manillas</b> continued to serve as money and decorative objects until the late 1940s and are still used as decorative objects in some contexts. In the popular consciousness, they are particularly associated with the Atlantic slave trade.|$|R

25|$|On 27 April 1565, {{the first}} {{permanent}} Spanish {{settlement in the}} Philippines was founded by Miguel López de Legazpi and the service of Manila Galleons was inaugurated. The <b>Manilla</b> Galleons shipped goods from all over Asia across the Pacific to Acapulco {{on the coast of}} Mexico. From there, the goods were transshipped across Mexico to the Spanish treasure fleets, for shipment to Spain. The Spanish trading post of Manila was established to facilitate this trade in 1572. The control of Guam, Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands, and Palau was later, {{from the end of the}} 17th century, and remained under Spanish control until 1898.|$|E
25|$|Although {{gold was}} the primary and abiding {{merchandise}} sought by the Portuguese, by the early 16th century they were participating in the slave trade for bearers to carry manillas to Africa's interior, and gradually manillas became the principal money of this trade. The Portuguese were soon shouldered aside by the British, French, and Dutch, {{all of whom had}} labor-intensive plantations in the West Indies, and later by the Americans whose southern states were tied to a cotton economy. A typical voyage took manillas and utilitarian brass objects such as pans and basins to West Africa, then slaves to America, and cotton back to the mills of Europe. The price of a slave, expressed in manillas, varied considerably according to time, place, and the specific type of <b>manilla</b> offered.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, an {{important}} producer of art was the Academia de San Carlos (San Carlos Art Academy), founded during colonial times, and which {{later became the}} Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (the National School of Arts) including painting, sculpture and graphic design, one of UNAM's art schools. Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos (National Museum of San Carlos). One of the students, José María Velasco, {{is considered one of}} the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century. Porfirio Díaz's regime sponsored arts, especially those that followed the French school. Popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished, e.g. those of José Guadalupe Posada and Manuel <b>Manilla.</b> The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt, Velázquez, Murillo, and Rubens.|$|E

2500|$|Copper bracelets and leg bands {{were the}} {{principal}} 'money' {{and they were}} usually worn by women to display their husband's wealth. Early Portuguese traders thus found a preexisting and very convenient willingness to accept unlimited numbers of these 'bracelets', and they are referred to by Duarte Pacheco Pereira who made voyages in the 1490s to buy ivory tusks, slaves, and pepper. He paid 12 to 15 <b>manillas</b> of brass for a slave, fewer if they were of copper. By 1522 in Benin a female slave 16 years of age cost 50 manillas; the King of Portugal put a limit of 40 <b>manillas</b> per slave to stop this inflation.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} hoard had a {{group of}} 72 pieces with similar patination and soil crusting, suggesting common burial. There were 7 Mkporo; 19 Nkobnkob-round foot; 9 Nkobnkob-oval foot; and 37 Popo-square foot. The lightest 'Nkobnkobs' in the hoard were 108 gm and 114 gm, while they are routinely found (called Onoudu) under 80 gm, this implies that the group was buried {{at a certain point}} in the size devolution of the <b>manilla.</b> Mkporo are made of brass. The weight correspondence of the oval-foot Nkobnkob with {{the high end of the}} round-foot range suggests that it is either the earlier variety, or contemporary with the earliest round-foots. The exclusive presence of the 'square-foot' variety of French Popo, normally scarce among circulation groups of Popos, suggests that this is the earliest variety. The earliest French manillas as likely to be contemporaries of the earliest British pieces.|$|E
25|$|In recent {{research}} that builds {{on his work}} in polymerisation, Gilbert has developed {{a new way of}} understanding the biochemistry of the enzymatic processes involved in starch biosynthesis, in collaboration with Dr Melissa Fitzgerald, International Rice Research Institute, <b>Manilla.</b> In this new field, he applied the methods he had developed for understanding molecular-weight distributions in synthetic polymers to understanding those of natural ones. He has thus created a powerful new technique for probing the enzymatic processes in starch biosynthesis in grains, again, creating a methodology to obtain reliable mechanistic knowledge by isolating steps in highly complex systems. Each enzymatic step that creates individual chains—analysed by debranching the starch—can now be associated with particular regions in the molecular-weight distribution of a starch. This supported the applicability of one of two rival mechanistic postulates made by starch biochemists. He has also recently developed a major innovation for solving the vexed problem of quantitatively interpreting data for branched systems.|$|E

2500|$|A {{class of}} heavier, more {{elongated}} pieces, probably produced in Africa, are often labelled by collectors as [...] "King" [...] or [...] "Queen" [...] <b>manillas.</b> Usually with flared ends {{and more often}} copper than brass, they show {{a wide range of}} faceting and design patterns. Plainer types were apparently bullion monies, but the fancier ones were owned by royalty and used as bride price and in a pre-funeral [...] "dying ceremony." [...] Unlike the smaller money-manillas, their range was not confined to west Africa. A distinctive brass type with four flat facets and slightly bulging square ends, ranging from about -, was produced by the Jonga of Zaire and called 'Onganda', or 'onglese', phonetic French for [...] "English.".

50|$|While the taxonomic {{history of}} these {{hornbills}} has been uneventful, {{the number of}} species in the Philippine Archipelago has been greatly debated. Traditionally, only a single Philippine species was recognized, the tarictic hornbill (P. panini).

Today most authorities accept this split, although some have recommended splitting the Samar (P. samarensis) from the Mindanao.|$|R
