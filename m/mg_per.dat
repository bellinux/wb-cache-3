A phase I trial of ARQ 197 {{was conducted to}} assess safety, tolerability, and target inhibition, including intratumoral c-MET signaling, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with solid tumors amenable to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies using serial biopsies, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and circulating endothelial cell (CEC) and circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration were enrolled. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients received ARQ 197 at 100 to 400 <b>mg</b> twice <b>per</b> day. ARQ 197 was well tolerated, with the most common toxicities being grade 1 to 2 fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 fatigue (200 <b>mg</b> twice <b>per</b> day; n = 1); grade 3 mucositis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and hypokalemia (400 <b>mg</b> twice <b>per</b> day; n = 1); and grade 3 to 4 febrile neutropenia (400 <b>mg</b> twice <b>per</b> day, n = 2; 360 <b>mg</b> twice <b>per</b> day, n = 1).
