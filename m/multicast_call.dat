40|$|Abstract—Hwang and Lin {{introduced}} a new nonblocking re-quirement for 2 -cast traffic which imposes different requirements on different types of coexisting calls. The requirement is strictly nonblocking for point-to-point calls among the 2 -cast traffic, and is rearrangeable for genuine 2 -cast calls. We generalize the 2 -cast calls to multicast calls and give a sufficient condition for such net-works {{when the number of}} multicast calls is upper bounded.

40|$|We {{consider}} a symmetric tree loss network that supports single-link (unicast) and multi-link (<b>multicast)</b> <b>calls</b> to nearest neighbors and has capacity C on each link. The network operates a control {{so that the}} number of <b>multicast</b> <b>calls</b> centered at any node cannot exceed C_V and the number of unicast calls at a link cannot exceed C_E, where C_E, C_V≤ C. We show that uniqueness of Gibbs measures on the infinite tree is equivalent to the convergence of certain recursions of a related map. For the case C_V= 1 and C_E=C, we precisely characterize the phase transition surface and show that the phase transition is always nonmonotone in the arrival rate of the <b>multicast</b> <b>calls.</b> This model {{is an example of a}} system with hard constraints that has weights attached to both the edges and nodes of the network and can be viewed as a generalization of the hard core model that arises in statistical mechanics and combinatorics. Some of the results obtained also hold for more general models than just the loss network. The proofs rely on a combination of techniques from probability theory and dynamical systems.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approximate}} analytical method to compute efficiently the call-blocking probabilities in wavelength -routing networks with multiple classes of both unicast and <b>multicast</b> <b>calls.</b> Our approach involves the following steps. We {{start with an}} approximate solution to a linear single-class unicast network which we developed earlier. Next, all classes of calls on a particular route are aggregated to give an equivalent single-class model. We then extend the path decomposition algorithms that we have developed for single-class networks to handle mesh networks with multiple classes of calls. We show {{how to use these}} path decomposition algorithms to decompose large networks with multicast paths into smaller subsystems with only linear paths, which, in turn, are solved by the product-form approximation algorithm. We also consider a state-dependent Poisson arrival process for <b>multicast</b> <b>calls</b> which is more accurate in capturing the behavior of these calls...|$|R
40|$|XTP is a {{transport}} protocol. A protocol is {{an agreement}} between the communicating parties on how communication is to proceed. For traditional transport layer connections, it is an error free point-to-point channel to provide reliable, cost-effective data transport from the source machine to the destination machine. The XTP is a new protocol with higher data rates, lower bit error rates, user defined service reliability, support multi-communication and latency controls, more suitable for today or the near future as modern networks continue to develop. Compared with traditional point-to-point communications, the XTP can provide efficient multicast data delivery, and the XTP also provides a powerful mechanism for group communication. Multicasting represents a powerful mechanism for group communication.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new architecture for a scalable multicast ATM switch {{from a few}} tens to thousands of input ports. The switch, called Abacus switch, has a nonblocking memoryless switch fabric followed by small switch modules at the output ports; the switch has input and output buffers. Cell replication, cell routing, output contention resolution, and cell addressing are all performed distributedly in the Abacus switch {{so that it can}} be scaled up to thousands input and output ports. A novel algorithm has been proposed to resolve output port contention while achieving input buffers sharing, fairness among the input ports, and <b>multicast</b> <b>call</b> splitting. The channel grouping concept is also adopted in the switch to reduce the hardware complexity and improve the switch's throughput.

40|$|Given the {{popularity}} of multicast services and applications, we study the problem of state dependent <b>multicast</b> <b>call</b> routing for single rate loss networks. We formulate the problem and discuss the difficulties to implement the optimurn solution. Because of these difficulties, a heuristic approach is proposed: we apply Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) searching with a suitable link cost function to search a connected tree for a <b>multicast</b> <b>call</b> connection request such that its normalized revenue loss can be reduced. If there is no connected tree available, the call connection request will be rejected. We develop analytical models of Least Load Multicast Routing (LLMR), which is a well-known multicast routing algorithm, for fully connected networks. The analytical models that we develop for calculating blocking probabilities {{are based on the}} Reduced Load Approximation (RLA) with the link independencle assumption. For symmetrical networks, our analytical models include both state aggregation, i. e. ALLMR, and alternative routing for point-to-point calls. The agreements between the simulation and analytical results in both scenarios are very good and we find that the agreements are not affected significantly by the link independence assumption. Four new link cost functions are proposed to improve the network performance in different ways: Aggregated Least Load Multicast Routing (ALLMR) gives a simpler implementation, lower signaling traffic for establishing conncction requests and lower sensitivity to the design parameters, compared with LLMR. Least Load Multicast Routing with Maximum Occupied Circuits (LLMRMOC) and Least Load Multicast Routing with Minimum Measured Blocking Time (LLMRMMBT) are modified LLMR algorithms which have moderate improvement with minimum additional cost, compared with LLMR. We also discuss their implementation issues. The Maximum Mean Number of New Calls Accepted Before Blocking Multicast Routing (MCBMR) algorithm can more accurately capture the current and future loading of a network. Simulation results show that this algorithm, compared with LLMR, not only has a smaller network revenue loss, but also results in smaller call blocking probabilities for all classcss of traffic. We also discuss the implementation issues of this proposed algorithrn and develop two approximation methods, state approximation and curve fitting, which can reduce the measurement complexity significantly with only a slight performance degradation...|$|E

A uniform reliable multicast of a message m has the property that if m has been received by any destination process (faulty or not), then m is received by all processes that reach a decision.

40|$|In this paper, we analyse a {{model of}} a regular tree loss network that {{supports}} two types of calls: unicast calls that require unit capacity on a single link, and multicast calls that require unit capacity on every link emanating from a node. We study the behaviour of the distribution of calls in the core of a large network that has uniform unicast and multicast arrival rates. At sufficiently high <b>multicast</b> <b>call</b> arrival rates the network exhibits a 'phase transition', leading to unfairness due to spatial variation in the multicast blocking probabilities. We study the dependence of the phase transition on unicast arrival rates, the coordination number of the network, and the parity of the capacity of edges in the network. Numerical results suggest that the nature of phase transitions is qualitatively different when there are odd and even capacities on the links. These phenomena are seen to persist even with the introduction of nonuniform arrival rates and multihop multicast calls into the network. Finally, we also show the inadequacy of approximations such as the Erlang fixed-point approximations when multicasting is present...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of constructing bandwidth-guaranteed multicast tree in multi-channel multi-interface wireless mesh networks. We focus on the scenario of dynamic <b>multicast</b> <b>call</b> arrival, where each call has a specific bandwidth requirement. A call is accepted if a multicast tree with sufficient bandwidth on each link can be constructed. Intuitively, if the carried load on both the most-heavily loaded channel and the most-heavily loaded node is minimized, the traffic load in the network will be balanced. If the network load is balanced, more room {{will be available for}} accommodating future calls. This would maximize the call acceptance rate in the network. With the above notion of load balancing in mind, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is formulated for constructing bandwidth-guaranteed tree. We show that the above problem is NP-hard, and an efficient heuristic algorithm called Largest Coverage Shortest-Path First (LC-SPF) is devised. Simulation results show that LC-SPF yields comparable call acceptance rate as the ILP formulation, but with much shorter running time. © 2010 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2009, p. 1 - 5 We {{consider}} multi-channel multi-interface wireless mesh networks with a schedule-based MAC protocol, where conflict-free {{transmission is}} ensured by requiring links assigned {{with the same}} channel and within the mutual interference range of each other to be active at different time slots. When a (point-to-multipoint) <b>multicast</b> <b>call</b> arrives, the call is accepted if a multicast distribution tree can be established for connecting the source node with all the receiving nodes, and with sufficient bandwidth reserved on each link. Otherwise, the call is rejected. To maximize the call acceptance rate, the multicast tree must be constructed judiciously upon each call arrival. Aiming at minimizing the carried load on the most-heavily loaded channel, and maximizing the residual capacity of the most heavily loaded node, an integer linear program (ILP) is formulated for multicast tree construction. Since solving ILP can be time-consuming, an efficient heuristic algorithm is then proposed. We compare the two tree construction algorithms by simulations. We found that both algorithms give comparable call acceptance rate, but the heuristic algorithm requires much shorter running time. © 2009 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new {{architecture}} for the copy network {{which is an}} integral part of multicast ATM switches. The new architecture makes use of the property that the broadcast Banyan network (BBN) is nonbloeking if the active inputs are cyclically concentrated and the outputs are monotone. In the new architecture, by employing a token ring reservation scheme, the outputs of the copy network are reserved before a multicast cell is replicated. By the new copy principle, tbe number of copies requested by a <b>multicast</b> <b>call</b> is not limited by the size of the copy network so that very large multicast switches can be configured in a modular fash]on. The sequence of cells is preserved in the new structure. Though physically separated, buffers within the copy network are completely shared, so that the throughput can reach 100 %, and the cell delay and the cell loss probability can he made to be very small. The cell delay is estimated analytically and by computer simulation, and the results of both are found to agree with each other. The relationship between the cell loss probability under various traffic parameters and buffer sizes is studied by computer simulation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} of multicast tree within given constraints, such as delay and capacity, {{is becoming a}} major problem in many wireless networks, especially wireless mesh networks (WMN). Due to the limited capacity of the wireless node, a <b>multicast</b> <b>call</b> may be dropped if there is no multicast tree formed within the given constraints. In this paper, we propose a new multicast tree construction algorithm which has maximum traffic flow and minimum delay under capacity constraints. The problem of multicast is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem with associated constraints. A cost function (CF) is defined to choose the less loaded route among the available ones. A Minimum Delay Maximum Flow Multicast (MDMF) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem using CF and associated constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm and CF is evaluated and compared with well-known algorithms with respect to packet delivery fraction, latency, and network throughput. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithm has a lesser number of transmissions for a given CF. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has high throughput, packet delivery fraction and less latency compared to other well-known algorithms in this category...|$|E
40|$|In a {{multicast}} switching network, fanout {{is defined}} {{to be the}} number of outputs {{that need to be}} connected to an input. It is well known that fanout sets the complexity of a multicast switch. In the classic three-stage Clos architecture. fanout is reduced to be the number of output switches that need to be reached from an input. Again this number has a strong bearing on the complexity of the entire switch. In real applications, like teleconferencing, three-way call, etc., most multicast connections have small fanouts. But we must design the switch so that it can handle the worst case condition. In first part this thesis, {{the development of a new}} architecture for multicast circuit switching network is presented. A fanout reduction is used in the new architecture to improve the efficiency of the Clos network. The new scheme reduces the complexity of the switch, and still maintain the general one-to-all multicast capability inside the switch. We demonstrate that even the better approach available for building a multicast network can be improved by this technique. The price we pay, however, is an increase in path setup time for connections with large fanouts. In the second part of the thesis, multicast packet switch architectures are studied. A fanout reduction scheme, similar to the scheme in the first part, for the multicast packet switch architecture is evaluated. This architecture required little extra cost to support <b>multicast</b> <b>call,</b> and the procedure of adding and deleting call parties is simple. The fanout reduction approach offers a new way of designing multicast interconnection networks...|$|E
