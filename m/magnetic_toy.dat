50|$|Many of {{his works}} involve intense {{observation}} and recording of the social, cultural and economic conditions of particular places, usually conceived during walks through urban areas. Citing walking as the centre of his practice, for his first performance The Collector (1991), he dragged a small <b>magnetic</b> <b>toy</b> dog on wheels through Mexico City so as to attract debris to it. In Fairy Tales (1995), he takes a walk after unravelling the sweater he has on, leaving an ever-lengthening, blue-thread trail in his wake. Also in 1995, Alÿs realised an action in São Paulo called The Leak in which he walked from a gallery, around the city, {{and back into the}} gallery trailing a dribbled line from an open can of blue paint. This action was reprised in 2004 when Alÿs walked along the armistice border in Jerusalem, known as 'the green line', carrying a can filled with green paint. The bottom of the can was perforated with a small hole, so the paint dripped out as a continuous squiggly line on the ground as he walked. The work Paradox of Praxis 1 (Sometimes Making Something Leads to Nothing) documents an action performed on the streets of Mexico City in 1997. The film depicts a simple and seemingly pointless endeavour - a large block of ice being pushed through the city streets for nine hours until it melts away to a puddle of meltwater.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inadvertent {{adjustments}} and malfunctions of programmable valves {{have been}} reported in cases in which patients have encountered powerful electromagnetic fields such as those involved in magnetic resonance imaging, but the potential effects of <b>magnetic</b> <b>toys</b> on programmable valves are not well known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The magnetic properties of nine toy magnets were examined. To calculate the effect of a single magnet over a distance, the magnetic flux density was directly measured using a calibrated Hall probe at seven different positions between 0 and 120 mm from the magnet. Strata II small (Medtronic Inc.), Codman Hakim (Codman & Shurtleff), and Polaris (Sophysa) programmable valves were then tested {{to determine the effects of}} the toy magnets on each valve type. RESULTS: The maximal flux density of different <b>magnetic</b> <b>toys</b> differed between 17 and 540 mT, inversely proportional to the distance between toy and measurement instrument. Alterations to Strata and Codman valve settings could be effected with all the <b>magnetic</b> <b>toys.</b> The distances that still led to an alteration of the valve settings differed from 10 to 50 mm (Strata), compared with 5 to 30 mm (Codman). Valve settings of Polaris could not be altered by any toy at any distance due to its architecture with two magnets adjusted in opposite directions. CONCLUSION: This is the first report describing changes in the pressure setting of some adjustable valves caused by <b>magnetic</b> <b>toys</b> in close contact. Parents, surgeons, neurologists, pediatric oncologists, and paramedics should be informed about the potential dangers of <b>magnetic</b> <b>toys</b> to prevent unwanted changes to pressure settings...|$|R
50|$|Although an {{international}} toy safety standard exists, nations {{around the world}} still create their own legislation and standards to address the issue.Current toy safety standards focus on design principles and rely on batch testing of samples to assure safety. As has {{been seen in the}} large scale recalls of 2007, sample testing can miss non-conforming product. A design may be conceptually safe, but without control of the production, the design may not be met by the manufacturer. Similarly, the applicable toy safety standards to which a toy is tested by a laboratory may not discover a hazard in a product: in the case of 2007's <b>magnetic</b> <b>toy</b> recalls and the Bindeez recall, the products in question met the requirements laid down in the applicable safety standard, yet were found to present an inherent risk.Proposed process and quality control standards, similar to the ISO 9000 systems, seek to eliminate production errors and control materials to avoid deviation from the design.The creation of manufacturing quality standards for toys will help ensure consistency of production. Using a continual improvement model, production can be subject to constant scrutiny, rather than assuming the compliance of all production by testing random samples.In October and November 2007, mandatory third party testing by companies such as LGA, Eurofins, Bureau Veritas or SGS Consumer Testing Services was proposed by regulators in the EU and US, to a (possibly new) international standard, requiring a new safety mark. There is no indication that the proposals will address manufacturing control.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Claudio Vicentelli, he discusses how he started with a prototype of wood, and eventually developed his idea to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>toy</b> how it is known today (Geomag classic and PRO). The {{turning point in the}} evolution of the project, occurred when Vicentelli was in the finalization of the design of the object, deciding how to best achieve an optimal balance between magnetic attraction force and weight. This is when the original idea was abandoned, the original form of a [...] "brick", and to move to a new system of bars and spheres instead. The choice allowed for the maintenance of the highest ratio of magnetic force and weight-cost of each unit, while also allowing for the possible development of the project and its subsequent marketing in a relatively short time. After the selection of the most efficient form, the next phase in the development of the toys was the research and the study of materials for the various components, in addition to choosing the most appropriate magnets. Complex calculations on the diameter of the bars and spheres allowed to obtain the coupling of two bars on the same sphere with angles less than 60 degrees, which is the necessary condition for the creation of triangular figures at the base of the game.The choice of using plastic to cover the bars posed as a difficult task, however it allowed to lighten the individual units (with a thickness of a few tenth of a millimeter), while ensuring a sufficient rigidity to support the three-dimensional shape of the figures once constructed. Another aspect of the project development that Vicentelli describes as being fundamentally important, is the protection of the components from oxidation and continuous rubbing. Once all of these solutions were put in place, Vicentelli concentrated on the optimization of the product. This was done by reducing the amount of plastic being used for the coatings, alongside the constant search for the increase of the ratio of strength / weight / cost while maintaining the same performance.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} cases which reported complication after cochlear implantation in children: displacement of magnet from the receiver pocket, possibly aided by the use of <b>magnetic</b> <b>toys.</b> We observed magnet displacement in two female children from the same family and in one male child. Age at implantation was 23, 51, and 24 months, respectively. Magnet displacement occurred at 37, 16, and 32 months, respectively after the initial surgery. The magnets were replaced under general anaesthesia and we did not observe recurrent magnet dislodgement. Measurements indicated that forces required to remove the magnet from its pocket were not greater than those exerted by <b>magnetic</b> <b>toys</b> or the magnet used in the external sender coil. Although magnet displacement is not common after cochlear implantation, it is a major complication in children where subsequent general anaesthesia and surgery are necessary to replace the magnet. Therefore, we propose that pockets for removable magnets of cochlear implants used in children should be redesigned to increase forces to remove the magnet or that removable magnets not be used at all...|$|R

Young children, in particular, are naturally curious and may intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins or button batteries, into their mouths.

40|$|Foreign body (FB) {{ingestion}} is {{a common}} emergency {{as well as a}} major cause of accidental injury and represents a severe public health problem in childhood, especially in infants. Most cases of FB ingestion reported in children aged between 6 months and 3 years depend primarily on the fact that young children are more likely to explore objects using their mouth and are not able to distinguish edible objects from nonedible ones, their teeth are physiologically lacking, and they have poor swallowing coordination. Although, sometimes it can cause serious complications, FB ingestion generally has a low mortality rate. However, accidental ingestion of <b>magnetic</b> <b>toys,</b> as a rare kind of FB mostly encountered in children, has now become more common due to the increased availability of objects and <b>toys</b> with <b>magnetic</b> elements.

40|$|Physics is {{not very}} popular with both {{children}} and adults alike. Studies show {{that one of the}} causes for the current situation might be a discordance between topics taught in the school curriculum and experiences from everyday life. Children are also too often put in passive roles during classes which, in many teachers’ opinions, is mostly due to lack of appropriate experimental equipment. A common remedy for both issues can be found in using toys in physics education. Many toys oﬀer opportunities to explore interesting physics principles that children are mostly unaware of during play. In this way, toys can bridge the gap between everyday life experiences and the process of learning physics laws during formal classes. Using physics toys in classroom activities can help children assume an active role which, in return, boosts their motivation and improves their attitude towards physics education.

40|$|Everyone {{has seen}} a bar magnet {{in the form of}} a compass or a door catch. Anyone who has ever casually played with magnets or <b>magnetic</b> <b>toys</b> knows that magnets {{interact}} with other magnets; i. e., a magnet experiences a force caused by thp presence of an external magnetic field produced by the other magnet. A wire carrying a current experiences a force caused by the presence of a nearby magnet (as you saw in the module Magnetic Forces). We then expect the converse to also hold true, i. e., that the bar magnet will also experience a force from the presence of the current-carrying wire. This expectation can be verified experimentally by putting a compass needle near a current-carrying wire. Thus both a bar magnet and a current-carrying wire produce a magnetic field. A bar magnet, however, cannot be broken down into a single magnetic pole similar to the electric charge. Even on the atomic scale, there are always two magnetic poles similar to the two magnetic poles produced by a small loop of current-carrying wire. A bar magnet is really just a collection of atomic current loops or charges in motion. In this module (and the module Magnetic Forces), you are actually investigating the interaction at a distance of moving electric charges (e. g., electric currents). The intermediary in this interaction is the magnetic field B(r). By introducing B, you separate the interaction into two parts: (1) creation of the B field by given currents (to be treated in this module), and (2) the action of this field on other given currents or moving charges (which you studied in Magnetic Forces). Along beside the other memorable force relations involving magnetic fields, you will now add to your collection of fond memories the field relations known as Ampere 2 ̆ 7 s Law and the Biot-Savart Law.

The mutual interaction between superconducting vortices and ferromagnetic domains has been investigated by the magneto-optical imaging technique. For thick Py layers, the stripe magnetic domain pattern guides both the smooth magnetic flux penetration {{as well as the}} abrupt vortex avalanches in the Nb film.
