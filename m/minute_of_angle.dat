The standard Mini-14 was discontinued and the name became the family name for all Mini-14 type rifles. As of 2005, all Mini-14 type rifles are now based on the Ranch Rifle design, with integral scope bases, a non-folding ghost ring aperture rear sight and a winged front sight similar to that used on the Ruger Police Carbine. These upgraded rifles have serial numbers beginning with 580 and are sometimes referred to as 580 series Ranch Rifles. They have new iron sights and a modified gas system designed to reduce barrel vibration and are capable of shooting 2 inch groups at 100 yards or 2 <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> (MOA) accuracy.|$|E

50|$|Like the RPK, the NHM-91 {{utilizes}} a heavier-gauge stamped {{sheet metal}} receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal {{instead of the}} 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or European AKM. Other Chinese-made AKM rifles such as the MAK 90 and NHM 90 have thicker receivers as well, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The MAK 90 rifles may have either a straight cut stamped receiver or a slant cut stamped receiver. Both were imported after the 1989 ban with thumb hole stocks. The MAK 91 has the long barrel as well, but features a milled, slant cut receiver. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 and MAK 91 rifles a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable <b>of</b> 2-2.5 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> accuracy or better with factory 7.62×39mm ammunition.|$|R

40|$|Twelve {{observers}} {{were asked to}} estimate the realism of projected star fields. The results clearly indicate that maximum realism is obtained f rom a star field which has the following characteristics: (1) sky (background) luminance is quite low, pre-ferably as in the outer space sky of candelas per square meter; (2) individual stars are small(1 <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> visual <b>angle),</b> appearing as point sources; and, (3) simu-lated stars are relatively bright, casting an illumination of about ft-candles upon {{the eye of the}} observer (approximately first to third magnitude, average).

40|$|Although {{the concept}} of visual {{threshold}} has long been used in psychophysics, its transplanting to visual landscape research is very new. Very few studies have attempted to look at visual thresholds in landscape settings, and none has ever produced any tangible results. This study {{was the first to}} have proposed a systematic organising structure for visual impact assessment procedures via three articulated visual thresholds - visual thresholds for detection, recognition and visual impact. Three sets of visual thresholds, which were defined as the points when 50 % of the viewers accomplished a requested perception task, were obtained through controlled slide-viewing testings using computer simulated images with modified visual attributes. Three contrasts, four visual sizes, two object types and four baseline landscape settings were the defined independent variables. Detection, recognition and visual preferential rating were the dependant variables. These variables were controlled, manipulated and combined using photorealistic computer imaging techniques from which a total of 88 simulations were produced. Two groups of randomly selected university students (94 altogether), half of whom pre-informed, were used as the test subjects on 88 pairs of "before" and "after" images in a strictly controlled environment. From the tests results, general and specific visual thresholds values were derived and four detailed multivariate logistic regression models for the thresholds were also established. In general, detection, recognition and visual impact thresholds were found to be around 27, 65 and 85 square minutes. But more precise results were given by the logistic regression equations which achieved an average prediction success of over 90 %. Many perceptual phenomena were also observed. For example, contrast weighted visual size (measured in square <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> subtended by an object multiplied by visual contrast) was found to be the determinant variable for visual detection, recognition and visual impact assessment; detection and recognition were found to be linearly related to the log visual size of the object; it was many times easier to detect an object on a darker background than on a brighter background, and pre-knowledge definitely increased people's ability to recognise objects. The term maximum visibility was redefined as the detection threshold, and {{the concept of}} perception radius (visibility, recognisability and impact threshold) was initiated and used. The obtained thresholds, equations and perceptual findings could be readily applied to landscape management systems and enable automated mapping and zoning of the maximum perception radii. Perhaps it is the establishment of the three articulated visual thresholds concepts and their quantitative definitions in landscape settings that will challenge and redefine the validity and true usefulness of the sensitivity levels and the current visibility theories upon which many existing visual management systems are built.

The subtension is linear with the distance, for example, 500 yards = 5.235 inches, and 1000 yards = 10.47 inches. Since many modern telescopic sights are adjustable in half (...) , quarter (...) , or eighth (...) MOA increments, also known as clicks, zeroing and adjustments are made by counting 2, 4 and 8 clicks per MOA respectively.|$|E

40|$|Accurate aerosol data at {{global scale}} {{are a key}} product for climate system monitoring. Maps of optical {{parameters}} of the atmosphere often result from application of numerical models or satellite images processing. Such maps usually exhibit very large cell sizes, {{of the order of}} 1 degree <b>of</b> arc <b>angle.</b> There is a need to increase their spatial resolution to obtain accurate atmospheric parameters data sets as input for climate change detection models. To improve the spatial resolution of such maps, an oversampling by linear or bi-cubic interpolation can be used. Even if such process increases the resolution, no additional information is brought and the accuracy of these maps is actually not improved. Other methods are based on a fusion process between maps of the parameter under concern and higher resolution maps of a correlated parameter. Maps resulting from this process are more accurate than the latter. Such fusion processes have already been performed on satellite images over urban areas and provided fruitful results. We propose in this paper an application of such data fusion process to improve the spatial resolution of climatological aerosols maps taken from the Global Aerosol Data Set (GADS). These maps have been constructed from different measurements and more extensive models. They present a very low spatial resolution (5 degrees <b>of</b> arc <b>angle).</b> We fused these data with Linke turbidity maps presenting a spatial resolution <b>of</b> 5 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> arc <b>angle.</b> Linke turbidity is a convenient factor taking into account water vapor and aerosols properties; it is mainly used to estimate solar irradiance at ground level. Linke turbidity can be linearly correlated with aerosols optical depth. The fusion process consists in extracting spatial details of Linke turbidity maps by wavelet decomposition. These details (or high spatial frequencies) are injected into GADS maps. We obtained aerosols maps with a spatial resolution of 0. 5 degrees <b>of</b> arc <b>angle.</b> These maps are much more detailed than the original maps.
