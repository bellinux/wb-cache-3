40|$|We {{consider}} {{wind power}} forecasts {{based on a}} number of different <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts</b> originating from three different global meteorological models. Wind power forecasts based on these <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts</b> have fairly similar performance. However, in the paper we show that the wind power forecast errors are relatively uncorrelated. For this reason we can combine the forecasts and obtain a final forecast which performs better than any of the individual forecasts. Optimal weights are found based on the bias of the individual forecasts and the variance-covariance matrix of the individual forecast errors. In the paper we show that quite significant improvements can be obtained using only a few different <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts.</b> ∗Corresponding author...|$|R
40|$|This study {{improves}} the Short term wind power forecasting to help bid the wind {{power in the}} electricity market. Supplying power lesser/greater than the expected power creates imbalance in the Electricity system. Hence electricity markets impose penalty for supplying power lesser/greater than expected power. Bidding right amount of power {{is an important issue}} for the electricity power producers. This issue is very relevant for a wind power producer due to the inherent nature of wind. Wind is characterised by uncertainty and volatility. This study proposes hybrid approaches that use the <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecast</b> of wind power and statistical models to improve the accuracy of the wind power <b>forecast</b> over <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecast.</b> The statistical methods used in the study are linear regression model, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour. The production data of ten wind farms in a portfolio, <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts</b> of the ten wind farms, total production of the portfolio and <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecast</b> of total production were collected for 532 days for every hour. These data were used to train and test the hybrid models. These hybrid models are then compared empirically with the <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts.</b> It is found that, for the data used for the study, hybrid model using artificial neural network performs the best but only slightly over the linear regression model. Followed by artificial neural network and linear regression model is support vector machine. Followed by support vector machine is K-Nearest Neighbour model. But all the hybrid models outperform the <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecast</b> of wind power.

In the Sahel, agriculture is primarily based on rainfed crops and it is often structurally inadequate to manage the climatic variability. Latest Early Warning approaches insist on two action levels: prevision and prevention. In its biophysical aspect, prevision is mainly based on tools and models utilizing satellite data to monitor the growing season.

40|$|Hydropower {{production}} requires optimal dam and reservoir {{management to}} prevent flooding damage and avoid operation losses. In a northern climate, where spring freshet constitutes the main inflow volume, seasonal forecasts {{can help to}} establish a yearly strategy. Long-term hydrological forecasts often rely on past observations of streamflow or meteorological data. Another alternative is to use ensemble <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts</b> produced by climate models. In this paper, those produced by the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Forecast) System 4 are examined and bias is characterized. Bias correction, through the linear scaling method, improves {{the performance of the}} raw ensemble <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts</b> in terms of continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Then, three seasonal ensemble hydrological forecasting systems are compared: (1)  the climatology of simulated streamflow, (2)  the ensemble hydrological forecasts based on climatology (ESP) and (3)  the hydrological forecasts based on bias-corrected ensemble <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts</b> from System 4 (corr-DSP). Simulated streamflow computed using observed meteorological data is used as benchmark. Accounting for initial conditions is valuable even for long-term forecasts. ESP and corr-DSP both outperform the climatology of simulated streamflow for lead times from 1 to 5 months depending on the season and watershed. Integrating information about future meteorological conditions also improves monthly volume forecasts. For the 1 -month lead time, a gain exists for almost all watersheds during winter, summer and fall. However, volume forecasts performance for spring varies from one watershed to another. For most of them, the performance is close to the performance of ESP. For longer lead times, the CRPS skill score is mostly in favour of ESP, even if for many watersheds, ESP and corr-DSP have comparable skill. Corr-DSP appears quite reliable but, in some cases, under-dispersion or bias is observed. A more complex bias-correction method should be further investigated to remedy this weakness and take more advantage of the ensemble forecasts produced by the climate model. Overall, in this study, bias-corrected ensemble <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts</b> appear to be an interesting source of information for hydrological forecasting for lead times up to 1 month. They could also complement ESP for longer lead times...|$|R
