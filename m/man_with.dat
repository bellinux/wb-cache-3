40|$|ABSTRACTPrevious {{research}} indicates that individuals with sexual problems {{are more likely to}} attribute negative sexual experiences to themselves, in contrast with sexually functional individuals who attribute negative experiences to external factors such as their partner, circumstance, or relationship. Both <b>men</b> <b>with</b> erectile dysfunction (ED) and <b>men</b> <b>with</b> premature ejaculation (PE) show such patterns, as demonstrated through separate studies. In this analysis of 1249 men responding to an online survey posted on the Internet, we undertook a head-to-head comparison of <b>men</b> <b>with</b> ED and PE problems to determine whether their attribution patterns, though clearly different from functional men, were also different from one another. We also compared <b>men</b> <b>with</b> combined PE and ED to <b>men</b> <b>with</b> just PE to ascertain whether patterns of self-blame in these men were greater. Results indicate that <b>men</b> <b>with</b> PE accepted a higher level of self-blame than <b>men</b> <b>with</b> ED for negative sexual experiences. Men with both PE and ED exhibited slightly stronger attribution patterns of self-blame. These results point out similarities and differences in attribution styles across <b>men</b> <b>with</b> various sexual problems, indicate that <b>men</b> <b>with</b> sexual problems may be vulnerable to self-fulfilling prophecies regarding any negative sexual experience, and suggest focal points for therapeutic strategies in helping such men to overcome negative self-perceptions...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the levels of bone mineral density (BMD) of the whole body (WB) and {{proximal}} femurs of physically active <b>men</b> <b>with</b> spinal cord injuries (SCI) to nonactive <b>men</b> <b>with</b> spinal cord injuries. Also, the lean muscle mass (LMM) of active <b>men</b> <b>with</b> SCI was compared to the LMM of nonactive <b>men</b> <b>with</b> SCI. In addition, BMD values of the radii of physically active <b>men</b> <b>with</b> SCI were compared to that of able bodied men of the same age. The subjects N. 46 were between the age of 20 - 55 (μ= 37. 83 ± 6. 63 years), and were at least 2 years post spinal cord injury. Subjects with SCI were matched on similar level of lesion of the spinal cord, age, height, weight, and years post injury for the purpose of analyzing data. There were 14 active <b>men</b> <b>with</b> paraplegia and 14 nonactive <b>men</b> <b>with</b> paraplegia, 9 active <b>men</b> <b>with</b> quadriplegia and 9 nonactive <b>men</b> <b>with</b> quadriplegia. All BMD data was obtained utilizing a Hologic QDR 1000 W dual energy x-ray absorptiometer. A two-factor (level by group) analysis of variance revealed no significant difference for all sites (Whole body, Total hip, radii, LMM) comparing the active and nonactive <b>men</b> <b>with</b> SCI. T-scores and z-scores generated from the Ho logic QDR 1000 /W were analyzed using two-factor ANOVA (level by group). The active <b>men</b> <b>with</b> paraplegia had significantly higher BMD levels for all sites when compared to the other groups. These values may be explained by the number of incomplete injuries in the experimental group. Subjects in the physically active group did not clearly show a statistically significant difference on any of the dependent measures. However, values for the dependent measures were higher for the physically active group compared to the values of the nonactive group...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Sexual {{dysfunction}} is prevalent {{and associated}} with a lower quality of life. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are associated with sexual dysfunction. One hypothesis is that the pelvic floor muscles play a central role. Comparison of the prevalence of sexual dysfunction between CPPS and LUTS is difficult {{as there is no}} consensus on how to measure sexual dysfunction. There is limited knowledge about factors that can influence the pelvic floor muscles and thereby influence sexual function. Therefore factors that can influence the pelvic floor muscles might be applicable for treatment and improving the sexual function. Method: Men who visited the Universitair Bekkenbodem Centrum Groningen (UBCG) with new complaints in the period 2010 - 2012, completed a questionnaire before the first consultation. A retrospective cohort study included these men that were diagnosed with CPPS or LUTS. Men with urological malignancy in their medical history or incomplete questionnaires were excluded. In total 44 <b>men</b> <b>with</b> CPPS, 47 <b>men</b> <b>with</b> LUTS and 3 <b>men</b> <b>with</b> CPPS and LUTS were included. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction could be calculated from the scores on the questionnaire. Then the prevalence of sexual dysfunction between CPPS and LUTS was compared. Factors that might influence sexual dysfunction were analysed. Results: No significant difference was seen in prevalence of sexual dysfunction between <b>men</b> <b>with</b> CPPS and <b>men</b> <b>with</b> LUTS. Men with CPPS showed significantly higher score on pain during or after sexual activity. Problems with defecation seems to be a significant predictor of sexual dysfunction in both <b>men</b> <b>with</b> CPPS and <b>men</b> <b>with</b> LUTS. The diagnosis CPPS or LUTS itself, micturition or pain complaints are no significant predictors of sexual dysfunction. Being 60 years or older is a significant predictor of sexual dysfunction in <b>men</b> <b>with</b> LUTS. Conclusion: In this study no significant difference was seen between <b>men</b> <b>with</b> CPPS and <b>men</b> <b>with</b> LUTS in prevalence of sexual dysfunction. One factor, influenced by the pelvic floor, that can predict sexual dysfunction in <b>men</b> <b>with</b> CPPS and <b>men</b> <b>with</b> LUTS, is defecation complaints. The age of <b>men</b> is associated <b>with</b> sexual dysfunction in <b>men</b> <b>with</b> LUTS. Problems with defecation can be treated and are associated with sexual dysfunction. In <b>men</b> <b>with</b> CPPS or LUTS {{it is important to have}} attention to sexual function and defecation. Further research is indicated to see if treatment of problems with defecation can improve sexual dysfunction. ...|$|R

There’s also {{growing body of evidence}} of frontal dysfunction in people with schizophrenia. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the planning abilities in <b>men</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia, <b>men</b> <b>with</b> localized frontal lobe lesions and healthy men. Method. A sample of 90 men participated in the study. They were divided into three groups: <b>men</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia (n= 30), <b>men</b> <b>with</b> localized frontal lobe lesions (n= 30) and healthy men (n= 30) as a control group. Planning abilities were assessed with a clinical trialbased on Tower of London task. Results. Significant differences in ToL measures were found between controls and <b>men</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia (Trials solved: p< 0. 01; Trials solved perfectly: p< 0. 05; Execution time: p< 0. 001) and between controls and <b>men</b> <b>with</b> frontal lobe lesions (Trials solved: p< 0. 001;Thinking time: p< 0. 05; Execution time: p< 0. 001).
