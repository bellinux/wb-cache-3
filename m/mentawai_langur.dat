50|$|The <b>Mentawai</b> <b>langur</b> (Presbytis potenziani) is {{a species}} of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} known for its range of primates, {{including}} the Kloss gibbon (Hylobates klossii), pig-tailed langur (Simias concolor), <b>Mentawai</b> <b>langur</b> (Presbytis potenziani) and Mentawai macaque (Macaca pagensis).|$|E
50|$|Though rarely {{documented}} in mammals, a few instances of distraction display {{have appeared in}} the literature. One researcher documented a distraction display performed by a female red squirrel in order to protect her young. When the nest was approached, the female attempted to lead the researcher away through the trees using a ventriloquistic call that resembled the cries of the young. An additional study documented distraction display in <b>Mentawai</b> <b>langurs,</b> whereby a male will call loudly and bounce on branches while the female and young are able to quietly hide.|$|R
3000|$|Of {{the four}} primate species {{occurring}} on Siberut, the Kloss gibbons, the <b>Mentawai</b> <b>langurs</b> and the pig-tailed langurs have been reasonably well studied (e.g. Tenaza 1975;Tilson 1977;Watanabe 1981;Tilson and Tenaza 1982;Whitten 1982 a;Whitten 1982 b;Whitten 1982 c;Tenaza and Tilson 1985;Fuentes 1997;Hadi et al. 2009 a;Erb et al. 2012 b;Hadi et al. 2012). In contrast, {{studies on the}} Siberut macaque are mainly limited to investigations on population size, acoustic traits, phylogenetic relationships and some preliminary observations on ecology (Whitten and Whitten 1982;Abegg and Thierry 2002 b;Roos et al. 2003;Ziegler et al. 2007;Schneider et al. 2008;Waltert et al. 2008;Quinten et al. 2009). Initially, Siberut macaques {{were thought to be}} a subspecies of southern pigtail macaques ([...] FoodenMacaca nemestrina pagensis: [...]...|$|R
50|$|The macaques' {{natural habitat}} is rainforest, {{but they can}} also be found in {{riverine}} and coastal swamp-forests. They live high above the forest floor in the canopy, forage between 24 and 36 meters and may sleep as high as 45 meters. The primary food of the species is figs. They may split into splinter groups to forage for food and to sleep. They will eat alongside groups of <b>Mentawai</b> <b>langurs.</b> M. pagensis groups consist of around five to 25 individuals. Typically, a group consists of a single male with adult females and their offspring. The male decides where to go and communicates this {{to the rest of the}} group with high-pitched cries. Roaming, solitary Pagai Island macaques may challenge the dominant male for his position, leading to aggressive fights. The natural predators of the species are the crested serpent eagle and the reticulated python. When these predators are spotted, the macaques will alert the rest of the group with a short, gruff bark.|$|R
50|$|Diurnal forest dwellers, {{they spend}} nearly their entire {{life in the}} trees. They live in groups of up to 21 animals (average 10 or fewer animals in most species) {{consisting}} of a male, several females, and their young. A few species have been observed in monogamous pairings (particularly the <b>Mentawai</b> <b>langur),</b> although {{this might be a}} reaction to the decrease of their habitat. Lone males and all-male groups have also been reported. The groups are hierarchically developed, with intergroup communication that is both vocal and postural.|$|E
30|$|Primate species {{richness}} on Mentawai is unusually high. On a land {{surface area of}} only 6, 549  km 2, Mentawai harbors five endemic primate species (Fuentes 1997 / 1997), the Kloss gibbon (Hylobates klossii), the <b>Mentawai</b> <b>langur</b> (Presbytis potenziani), the pig-tailed langur or pig-tailed snub-nosed monkey (Simias concolor), the Pagai island macaque (Macaca pagensis) and the Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu). Whereas the first three species occur on all four islands, M. pagensis only occurs on the three southern islands, and M. siberu exclusively on Siberut. All Mentawaian primates {{are included in the}} IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2012). They are threatened by habitat loss due to legal and illegal logging, conversion of the forest into oil palm plantations, forest clearing, extraction of forest products (such as rattan), hunting and pet trade (Whittaker 2006). In Siberut, forest cover has decreased to 60 % (by 2005; Whittaker 2006), but part of it is protected by the national park, which includes 465  km 2 of protected “no-use” sanctuary zone where no hunting and logging is allowed (WWF 1980; Fuentes 1997 / 1997;Whittaker 2006).|$|E
