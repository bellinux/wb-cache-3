40|$|<b>Moral</b> <b>value</b> {{education}} {{is both a}} demand and a need for human beings {{as a manifestation of}} togetherness in terms of nations and countries with a variety of problems. There are a lot of problems, such as global terrorism and multidimensional crises, which one country cannot solve on its own because to do so it needs other countries’ supports. <b>Moral</b> <b>value</b> {{education is}} an alternative problem solution which is local, regional, national, and international in nature. It has become a global issue in several countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and China) and it has some differences and similarities. The differences result from the countries’ different ideologies. However, such countries emphasize <b>moral</b> <b>value</b> education on <b>moral</b> ethic <b>values,</b> especially on values related to human rights that are universal and global in nature. The concept of <b>moral</b> <b>value</b> education proposed by Kohlberg and Miller tends to be individualistic. Therefore, its needs to be complemented by taking account of the paradigm proposed by Capra that human life is built {{on the basis of a}} systemic and holistic view of life, one which is not partial and individualistic. In its implementation, it needs an appropriate approach and a relevant method and technique. The approaches to <b>moral</b> <b>value</b> education include inculcating, modelling, facilitating, and skill development approaches, and the methods include dogmatic, deductive, inductive, and reflective methods.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{two main}} problems: (1) {{the identity of}} beings with moral standing and (2) the adjudication of conflicts arising between beings with moral standing. Solving (1) provides a vehicle for treating (2). Various features of beings identify them as having different kinds of moral standing. These varieties of standing correspond to varying degrees of <b>moral</b> <b>value,</b> establishing a hierarchy of moral priority. Conflicts between beings with moral standing are then adjudicated {{in favor of the}} party to the conflict who has the most or weightiest <b>moral</b> <b>value.</b> <b>Moral</b> agents have the weightiest <b>moral</b> <b>value</b> in virtue of their cognitive and affective capacities. Nonhuman mammalian species have a lesser degree of <b>moral</b> <b>value</b> since they lack the cognitive capacities of agents but share their affective capacities. Birds, reptiles, and fish have even less <b>moral</b> <b>value</b> because they have only sentience. Finally, the weakest degree of <b>moral</b> <b>value</b> is had by nonconscious beings, notably plants, which have only a good-of-their-own. Natural objects and artifacts have no <b>moral</b> <b>value</b> at all since they have no cognitive or affective capacities, and no good-of-their-own. Even though moral agents are more valuable from the moral point of view than any other being with moral standing, {{this does not mean that}} the interests or good of agents always take precedence over the interests or good of other, nonhuman beings. It is only on those occasions where the basic welfare interests of agents are at stake that a conflict between human and nonhuman beings is resolved in favor of moral agents. In situations where the welfare interests of agents are not at stake [...] though other non-basic interests may be [...] while the welfare interests or basic good of nonhumans are at stake, the conflict is adjudicated in favor of the nonhumans...|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} justice {{to the exclusion of}} other <b>moral</b> <b>values,</b> such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E
5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her <b>moral</b> <b>values</b> and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against <b>moral</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Deluge, {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows {{a scene from the}} story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of <b>moral</b> <b>values,</b> and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda {{does not}} {{have a long history of}} written literature, but there is a strong oral {{tradition}} ranging from poetry to folk stories. Many of the country's <b>moral</b> <b>values</b> and details of history have been passed down through the generations. The most famous Rwandan literary figure was Alexis Kagame (1912–1981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry. The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as Benjamin Sehene. A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the Golden Globe-nominated Hotel Rwanda, Shake Hands with the Devil, Sometimes in April, and Shooting Dogs, the last two having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.|$|E
40|$|Using {{human embryos}} in {{research}} remains a controversial issue, especially in Christian bioethics. Although the official Catholic stance rejects {{human embryonic stem}} cell research, Christian thinkers T. Peters, K. Lebacqz and G. Bennett support it.

5|$|The {{title of}} the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to Hindu mythology are {{abundant}} in the film, and its lead character {{has been seen as}} a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high <b>moral</b> <b>values</b> and the concept {{of what it means to}} be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh states. The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.|$|E
5|$|Liniers was {{succeeded by}} Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros {{a few months}} later, who pardoned the mutineers to reduce {{political}} conflicts. Cisneros allowed free trade as well, as instructed by the Junta of Seville, which benefited British merchants; Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War. The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this would hurt the local economy, <b>moral</b> <b>values,</b> social usages, religious practices, and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy. As a result, Cisneros closed trade again, restoring the Spanish monopsony. A group of hacendados (owners of haciendas), who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo, asked Moreno to defend them. Moreno wrote The Representation of the Landowners, a report that represented the export interest of the landowners, encouraged free trade, and condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the monopsony. It is considered the most comprehensive economic report {{from the time of}} the viceroyalty. It represented the new European economic ideas, and noted that the legal monopsony with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled. Several authors have questioned Moreno's authorship of the paper, considering it instead an update of another, previously drafted by Manuel Belgrano, Secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers. This report, as well as Moreno's prestige in the colonial society, helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros. Yet secretly, Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that <b>moral</b> <b>values</b> do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E
