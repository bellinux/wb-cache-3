The 'Let's Stay Put for Literacy and Numeracy Learning' project has a two pronged approach: 1. The professional development of teachers to understand student needs and intervention strategies – as they pertain to <b>mobile</b> <b>students,</b> <b>mobile</b> Indigenous <b>students.</b> 2. The case management of individual students – that is, <b>mobile</b> <b>students,</b> and in particular <b>mobile</b> Indigenous <b>students.</b> The aims of the 'Let's Stay Put for Literacy and Numeracy Learning' project will build an understanding of student mobility and its impact on learning, particularly in literacy and numeracy, through: - Developing innovative student centred approaches and interventions to address issues of mobility. - Lifting teacher capacity by building professional development networks and resources. - Implementing whole-of-school strategies that can be used and applied across the school/s. - Building the evidence-base on mobility and its impact on student learning. Long-term objectives are to: - Improve student literacy/numeracy data for <b>mobile</b> <b>students.</b> - Increase teacher, school and system knowledge and skills of the needs of <b>mobile</b> <b>students.</b> - Reduce rates of student mobility...|$|R

A key source of this diversity is international students and an understanding of the backgrounds of these students and their expectations is central to ensure effective delivery of educational and support services and to enhance student experience, and satisfaction. This study is focussed on four groups of Asian postgraduate students studying in Australian universities and investigates the influence of personal values in enhancing university experience and student satisfaction. Using multivariate data analysis and Structural Equation Modelling, this paper argues that personal values are predictors of individual behaviour and decision making which could impact on how they assess their university experience and satisfaction with the learning environment...|$|E

40|$|School {{mobility}} {{is widely}} {{held to be}} disruptive to students' education either directly, by disrupting curriculum continuity or indirectly through social stress and engagement issues affecting the student. Paradoxically, mobility has not been consistently linked to poorer academic outcomes; where mobility was linked with lower academic achievement, behaviour problems and/or inadequate adjustment issues were also found. Adjustment problems implicate student coping strategies. There is {{a gap in the}} mobility literature in relation to coping strategies. This study tests the hypothesis that when particular academic coping strategies are employed by <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> academic achievement is supported and behavioural problems are avoided. A sample of over one thousand secondary students was employed to gather measures of mobility, academic achievement, suspensions and coping strategies in the pursuit of the following questions: 1. 	Is mobility linked to lower achievement in Australian students? 2. 	Is mobility linked to suspensions in Australian students? 3. 	Are coping strategies employed by <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> whose academic achievement is satisfactory or better different from those employed by <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> who are failing? 4. 	Are coping strategies employed by <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> who are suspended different from those employed by <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> who are never suspended? Supporting prior findings the <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> of this study achieved at lower levels and had more suspensions than the non-mobile students. Results indicate that positive coping strategies {{play an important role in}} the achievement profile of <b>mobile</b> <b>students.</b> Adaptive coping was linked to higher academic achievement while the converse was found for non-productive coping strategies in <b>mobile</b> <b>students.</b> Possible explanations for prior inconsistent findings are suggested. Children of mobile middle and high SES families and those whose moves are necessitated by parental employment such as military families, rarely report negative effects. In addition, pre-existing differences have been found to account for achievement differences between <b>mobile</b> and other <b>students</b> in longitudinal studies. Results here suggest that it is not only mobility per se that determines children's outcomes but rather the reasons for moving and the family's attitude to moving. Adolescent's coping repertoires have been found to be largely developed over time in concert with their family's reactions to the range of circumstances they face. They result from socialising influences found within the family. Strategies modelled at home might be the ones the child/adolescent learns to use to manage stress. This could explain why children of some highly mobile families rarely report adverse academic achievement outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the factors that influence}} the college choice decisions of high school seniors to matriculate in a cooperative education institution of higher education. ^ This study used the statistical technique logistic regression to estimate the probability that a student would attend a cooperative education institution. A sample of 465 high school seniors was drawn from a database of 25, 500 Pennsylvania high school seniors, who had their SAT scores sent to various cooperative education institutions for acceptance in the Fall of 1986. ^ The results indicate that the two primary factors associated with the decision of high school seniors to attend a cooperative education institution of higher education are net price and the selectivity of institutions in their choice set. The findings suggest that <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> (students applying to primarily regional and national institutions) see cooperative education as having high utility. These students are relatively less sensitive to price changes, such that a modest increase in the net price of the co-op institution will not drive them to choose one of the other alternatives in their choice set. The economic substitution effect is minimal, because these high school seniors see few public college or public university alternatives for cooperative education. They are willing and able to pay more to attend a cooperative education institution. ^ Less <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> (applied to primarily local and instate institutions) with only public alternatives in their choice sets appear to exhibit the opposite behavior. They are highly sensitive to price changes. <b>Mobile</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 college choice behavior is predicated upon the institutional attributes of price rather than the 2 ̆ 2 cooperativeness 2 ̆ 2 of the institutions in their choice set. The results suggest that less <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> are price shopping for institutions, substituting higher cost institutions with lower cost institutions. ^ The primary conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that a decrease in financial aid to <b>mobile</b> <b>students</b> with only public alternatives, would only modestly alter the probability they will attend a co-op institution. While, for less <b>mobile</b> <b>students,</b> with only public alternatives, an increase in financial aid modestly increases the probability they will enroll in a co-op institution. ...|$|R

Methodologically, we base our paper on a longitudinal in-depth case study that focussed on the teaching, learning and assessment practices in Greek public sector universities. Based on our Greek case example we specifically focus on how the delegation of plagiarism detection to a technical actor produces a particular set of agencies and intentionalities (a politics one might say) which unintentionally and unexpectedly conspires to constitute some students as plagiarists (who are not) and others as not (who are). We suggest that this is best explored by looking exactly at what is rendered visible and invisible in such imbrications.

Drawing on specific findings from a large-scale student survey, a small-scale staff survey and focus groups conducted with Student Rovers themselves relating to perceptions of the socio-institutional status of Student Rovers, the paper is concerned with exploring the anomalous nature of the Student Rover role and speculating as to the potential for change inherent within this situation.

This increases the need for universities to adapt to their social and economic environment and to their clients, including the political trends and financial opportunities in Sweden and EU, {{if they are to}} successfully implement sustainability reforms. In this regard, we examine the barriers faced by a ‘post-normal’ education for sustainable development (ESD) inherent within the structures of a ‘normal’ University. We pose the question whether Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) as a post-normal process can contribute to increased capacity of normal higher {{education institutions}} to address complex sustainability problems? IWRM is conceptualised as an interactionist process of social learning and adaptive management to reflect on the experiences from one particular case, namely the Master Programme in IWRM at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. We illustrate how IWRM can contribute to address conflicts of interests in education arising from competing claims of stakeholders in real life management situations, but also to reconcile the conflicts associated with institutional adaptation under conditions characterised by a new international educational regime and rapidly changing market conditions. The paper brings together the discourse on ESD with lessons from IWRM and contends that the interactionist approach might offer a useful alternative to realist conceptions of ESD in learner-centred and institutional systemic approaches. Contrary to other reports on IWRM education, this paper reflects on this role of IWRM within higher education per se...|$|E

Tutors produced their own mobile-accessible materials to suit and support their students (including the use of SMS texting), for course-specific knowledge and more general study issues. Increasingly the OU is developing mobile access options and the use of web 2. 0 tools is growing within specific courses. SMS texting and the rich media available for mobile learning have proved to be useful and engaging to students. Interestingly, students gave importance to the affective aspects that were bound up with the practical uses of these technologies. Distance institutions work hard to overcome any feelings of isolation inherent in the distance learning process, by providing personal and online communication options: my research showed that students felt that they became more involved with the tutor, tutor group, or general student community, and for some students perhaps mobile access could lead to an increase in motivation and self-confidence and thus improve the likelihood of course completion. I describe a composite model of <b>mobile</b> <b>student</b> support: practical options to support students with their scheduling, in communicating with the institution and each other, in accessing services and resources, in their skills development, and to enhance their perceived connection with the institution.

Despite research on each of these factors, no investigations have addressed these factors in conjunction with each other. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of high student mobility on classroom teachers' promotion-retention decisions. Additionally, other factors that may influence classroom teachers' promotion-retention decisions were examined. Two hundred twelve elementary school teachers evaluated two case studies: one of a highly <b>mobile</b> <b>student,</b> and one of a non-mobile student. Each subsequently made a decision to either retain or promote that student. Both first grade and fifth grade students were considered.

Examination of various factors on a retention questionnaire revealed that different factors emerged as most important to the teachers when making promotion-retention decisions. The factors differed for both grade level and mobility status. The results were discussed in relation to interventions that may be warranted in an attempt to alleviate disadvantages in entering a new school.
