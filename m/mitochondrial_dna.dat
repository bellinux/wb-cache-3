5|$|Joy Ibsen, {{a retired}} journalist, died in 2008, leaving three children: Michael, Jeff and Leslie. On 24 August 2012, her son Michael (born in Canada in 1957, a cabinet maker based in London) gave a mouth-swab sample to the {{research}} team to compare with samples from the human remains found at the excavation. Analysts found a <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> match between the exhumed skeleton, Michael Ibsen, and an unnamed second direct maternal line descendant, who shares a relatively rare <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence, <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> haplogroup J1c2c.|$|E
5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Because all the <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the evolutionary history of populations. The classic example of this is in human evolutionary genetics, where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large evolutionary distance between the <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E
5|$|Ashdown-Hill's {{research}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} a challenge in 2003 to provide a DNA sequence for Richard's sister Margaret, to identify bones found in her burial place, the Franciscan priory church in Mechelen, Belgium. He tried to extract a <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence from a preserved hair from Edward IV held by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford but the attempt proved unsuccessful, owing to degradation of the DNA. Ashdown-Hill turned instead to genealogical research to identify an all-female-line descendant of Cecily Neville, Richard's mother. After two years he found a British-born woman who had emigrated to Canada after World War II, Joy Ibsen (née Brown), was a direct descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York (and therefore Richard's 16th-generation great-niece). Ibsen's <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> was tested and found to belong to <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> Haplogroup J, which by deduction should be Richard's <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> haplogroup. The mtDNA obtained from Ibsen showed that the Mechelen bones were not those of Margaret.|$|E
40|$|Chloroplast and <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs</b> {{from six}} races of annual {{teosinte}} (Guatemala, Huehuetenango, Balsas, Central Plateau, Chalco, and Nobogame), perennial teosinte, and maize were compared and grouped by restriction endonuclease fragment analyses. Three groups of chloroplast DNAs were detected: (i) perennial teosinte and Guatemala; (ii) Balsas and Huehuetenango; and (iii) all other teosintes. Four groups of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs</b> were separated: (i) perennial teosinte; (ii) Guatemala; (iii) Nobogame; and (iv) all other teosintes. Separation of the teosinte and maize organelle DNAs into five groups (Guatemala; perennial teosinte; Balsas and Huehuetenango; Central Plateau and Chalco; Nobogame and maize) approximated the biosystematic relationships of the taxa. It was {{suggested that the}} evolutions of the chloroplast and <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs</b> may be independent of each other, that variation of organelle DNA within a species complex of an organism may be the common condition, and that the DNAs of the organelle and nuclear systems evolve in reasonable harmony...|$|R

5|$|Uniparental {{inheritance}} {{leads to}} little opportunity for genetic recombination between different lineages of mitochondria, although a single mitochondrion can contain 2–10 copies of its DNA. For this reason, <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> is usually thought to reproduce by binary fission. What recombination does take place maintains genetic integrity rather than maintaining diversity. However, there are studies showing evidence of recombination in <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA.</b> It {{is clear that}} the enzymes necessary for recombination are present in mammalian cells. Further, evidence suggests that animal mitochondria can undergo recombination. The data are a bit more controversial in humans, although indirect evidence of recombination exists. If recombination does not occur, the whole <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence represents a single haplotype, which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary history of populations.|$|E

25|$|The {{chloroplast}} genome {{most commonly}} includes around 100 genes that code {{for a variety}} of things, mostly to do with the protein pipeline and photosynthesis.

40|$|We {{constructed}} restriction-site {{and gene}} maps for <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs</b> from seven isolates of five species of Suillus (Boletaceae, Basidiomycotina). Each mitochondrial genome exists {{as a single}} circular chromosome, {{ranging in size from}} 36 to 121 kb. Comparisons within species and between two closely related species revealed that insertions and deletions are the major form of genome change, whereas most restriction sites are conserved. Among more distantly related species, size and restriction-site differences were too great to allow precise alignments of maps, but small clusters of putatively homologous restriction sites were found. Two mitochondrial gene orders exist in the five species. These orders differ only by the relative positions of the genes for ATPase subunit 9 and the small ribosomal RNA and are interconvertible by a single transposition. One of the two gene arrangements is shared by four species whose <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs</b> span the entire size range of 36 to 121 kb. The conservation of gene order in molecules that vary over three-fold in size and share few restriction sites demonstrates a low frequency of rearrangements relative to insertions, deletions, and base substitutions...|$|R
5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} genetic {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (<b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA).</b> There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic variation in <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA.</b> There is also regional variation in <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant oxidative stress in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, it was {{discovered}} that mitochondria contained ribosomes. In 1968, methods were developed for mapping the mitochondrial genes, with the genetic and physical map of yeast <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA</b> being completed in 1976.|$|E

The history of the Etruscans is at the roots of Mediterranean culture and civilization, but their origin is still debated: local or Eastern provenance? To shed light on this mystery, bovine and human <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs</b> (mtDNAs) have been investigated, based on the well-recognized strict legacy which links human and livestock populations...|$|R
40|$|Maternally {{inherited}} mutations, such as cytoplasmic male sterility, {{provide useful}} systems {{in which to}} study the function of plant mitochondrial genomes and also their interaction with nuclear genes. We have studied the organization and expression of the organelle genomes of the male-sterile cytoplasm of Ogura radish and compared them with those of normal radish to identify alterations that might be involved in cytoplasmic male sterility. The chloroplast DNAs of Ogura and normal radish are virtually indistinguishable, whereas their <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs</b> are highly rearranged. Alignment of a restriction map constructed for the 257 -kilobase Ogura mitochondrial genome with that published for the 242 -kilobase genome of normal radish reveals that the two <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs</b> differ in arrangement by at least 10 inversions. The transcriptional patterns of several known mitochondrial genes and of rearranged mitochondrial sequences were examined in three nuclear backgrounds. Altered transcripts were observed for three mitochondrial genes, atpA, atp 6, and coxI. Rearrangements map near each of these genes and therefore {{may be responsible for}} their transcriptional alterations. Radish nuclear genes that restore fertility to the Ogura cytoplasm have no effect on the atp 6 and coxI transcripts, but do influence the atpA transcriptional pattern...|$|R

50|$|Nuclear DNA {{comprises}} most of {{the genome}} of an organism and in sexually reproducing organisms is inherited from both parents, in contrast to <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNA's</b> maternal pattern of inheritance. Leigh syndrome caused by nuclear DNA mutations is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that two copies of the mutated gene are required to cause the disease, so two unaffected parents, each of whom carries one mutant allele, can have an affected child if that child inherits the mutant allele from both parents.|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} {{regions of}} the mitochondrial genome that potentially could specify the "Polima" (pol) cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) of Brassica napus, transcripts of 14 mitochondrial genes from nap (male fertile), pol (male sterile), and nuclear fertility-restored pol cytoplasm plants were analyzed. Transcriptional differences among these plants were detected only with the ATPase subunit 6 (atp 6) gene. Structural analysis of the atp 6 gene regions of pol and nap <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs</b> showed that rearrangements in the pol mitochondrial genome occurring upstream of atp 6 have generated a chimeric 224 -codon open reading frame, designated orf 224, that is cotranscribed with atp 6. In CMS plants, most transcripts of this region are dicistronic, comprising both orf 224 and atp 6 sequences. Nuclear restorer genes at either of two distinct loci appear to specifically alter this transcript pattern such that monocistronic atp 6 transcripts predominate. The differences in expression of this region appear to result, in part, from differential processing of a tRNA-like element comprising a tRNA pseudogene present immediately upstream of atp 6 in both the sterile and fertile <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Possible mechanisms by which expression of the orf 224 /atp 6 locus and the Polima CMS trait may be specifically related are considered...|$|R

5|$|In 1991, {{the bodies}} of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were exhumed from a mass grave near Yekaterinburg.
