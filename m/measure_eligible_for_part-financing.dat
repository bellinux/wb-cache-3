40|$|Stochastic {{optimization}} problems often {{involve the}} expectation in its objective. When risk {{is incorporated in}} the problem description as well, then risk measures have {{to be involved in}} addition to quantify the acceptable risk, often in the objective. For this purpose {{it is important to have}} an adjusted, adapted and efficient evaluation scheme for the risk measure available. In this article different representations of an important class of risk measures, the spectral risk measures, are elaborated. The results allow concise problem formulations, they are particularly adapted for stochastic optimization problems. Efficient evaluation algorithms can be built on these new results, which finally make optimization problems involving spectral risk <b>measures</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> stochastic optimization...|$|R

However, this has never been investigated in critical care medicine. Thus, the present study aimed to examine the presence and extent of small-study effects in critical care medicine. Methods: Critical care meta-analyses involving randomized controlled trials and reported mortality as an outcome <b>measure</b> were considered <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> the study. Component trials were classified as large (≥ 100 patients per arm...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} effectiveness of rehabilitation for persons with unilateral neglect (UN) after stroke was conducted by searching the computerized databases from 1997 through 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of neglect treatment strategies for stroke patients which used the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) as the primary outcome <b>measure</b> were <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> inclusion. Out of 201 studies initially identified, 12 RCTs covering 277 participants were selected for analysis. All had the same weakness of low power with smaller samples and limitation in the blinding of the design. Prism Adaptation (PA) was the most commonly used intervention while continuous Theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) appeared to be a new approach. Meta-analysis showed that for immediate effects, the BIT conventional subscore had a significant and large mean effect size (ES= 0. 76; 95 % CI 0. 28 – 1. 23; p= 0. 002) whereas the BIT total score showed a modestly significant mean ES (ES = 0. 55; 95 % CI 0. 16 – 0. 94; p= 0. 006). No significant mean ES in sensitivity analysis was found for long-lasting effects across all BIT outcomes. PA appeared to be the most effective intervention {{based on the results of}} pooled analysis. More rigorous studies should be done on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) before it can be conclude...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Patient {{handling}} intervention strategies are many and varied. The focus of interventions has primarily {{been on the}} health, safety and welfare of care givers. Data from 4 EU focus groups and 2 world-wide expert panels were used to evaluate whether other types of outcomes were perceived as having relative importance. Qualitative and quantitative analysis showed that organisational and patient outcomes were also highly rated by the participants. The data had good agreement between the 4 different EU sources (Kendall’s Concordance significant at 0. 005) and the 12 highest rated <b>measures</b> were considered <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> inclusion in further study. In parallel, a wide ranging analysis of patient handling intervention literature was considered to evaluate the qualities of each individual study.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} statins for erectile dysfunction (ED), a systematic {{review of the literature}} was conducted in the Cochrane Library, Embase and PubMed from the inception of each database to June 2013. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment for ED with statins were identified. Placebo RCTs with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) as the outcome <b>measure</b> were <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> meta-analysis. A total of seven RCTs including two statins with a total of 586 patients strictly met our criteria for systematic review and five of them qualified for the meta-analysis. A meta-analysis using a random effects model showed that statins were associated with a significant increase in IIEF- 5 scores (mean difference (MD) : 3. 27; 95 % confidential interval (CI) : 1. 51 to 5. 02; P < 0. 01) and an overall improvement of lipid profiles including total cholesterol (MD: − 1. 08; 95 % CI: − 1. 68 to − 0. 48; P < 0. 01), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD: − 1. 43; 95 % CI: − 2. 07 to − 0. 79; P < 0. 01), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (MD: 0. 24; 95 % CI: 0. 13 to 0. 35; P < 0. 01) and triglycerides (TGs) (MD: − 0. 55; 95 % CI: − 0. 61 to − 0. 48; P < 0. 01). In summary, our study revealed positive consequences of these lipid-lowering drugs on erectile function, especially for nonresponders to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 Is). However, {{it has been reported that}} statin therapy may reduce levels of testosterone and aggravate symptoms of ED. Therefore, larger, well-designed RCTs are needed to investigate the double-edged role of statins in the treatment of ED...|$|R
