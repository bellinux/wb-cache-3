25|$|Money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> in Europe {{have always}} had much lower levels of {{investments}} capital than in the United States or Japan. Regulations in the EU have always encouraged investors to use banks rather than money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> for short-term deposits.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the SEC is {{adopting}} amendments {{designed to}} make money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> to report additional information to the SEC and to investors. Additionally, stress testing will be required and a key focus will {{be placed on the}} funds ability to maintain weekly liquid assets of at least 10%. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have many of the same economic features as money <b>market</b> <b>funds,</b> to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC.|$|E
25|$|Ultrashort {{bond funds}} are mutual funds, similar to money <b>market</b> <b>funds,</b> that, {{as the name}} implies, invest in bonds with {{extremely}} short maturities. Unlike money <b>market</b> <b>funds,</b> however, there are no restrictions {{on the quality of}} the investments they hold. Instead, ultrashort bond funds typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return. Since these high-risk securities can experience large swings in price or even default, ultrashort bond funds, unlike money <b>market</b> <b>funds,</b> do not seek to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and may lose money or dip below the $1.00 mark in the short term. Finally, because they invest in lower quality securities, ultrashort bond funds are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of 2007–2010.|$|E
25|$|A {{money market}} fund (also called a money market mutual fund) is an {{open-ended}} mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities such as US Treasury bills and commercial paper. Money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> are widely (though not necessarily accurately) regarded as being as safe as bank deposits yet providing a higher yield. Regulated in the United States under the Investment Company Act of 1940, money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> are important providers of liquidity to financial intermediaries.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, bank {{interest}} rates in Japan were near zero {{for an extended period}} of time. To search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits, investors used money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> for short-term deposits instead. However, several money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> fell off short of their stable value in 2001 due to the bankruptcy of Enron, in which several Japanese funds had invested, and investors fled into government-insured bank accounts. Since then the total value of money markets have remained low.|$|E

25|$|To many retail investors, money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> are confusingly {{similar to}} {{traditional}} bank demand deposits. Virtually all large money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> offer check writing, ACH transfers, wiring of funds, associated debit and credit cards, detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions, copies of canceled checks, etc. This makes {{it appear that}} cash is actually in the individual’s account. With net asset values reported flat at $1.00, despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets, an impression of rock solid stability is maintained. To help maintain this impression, money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses, or cut their management fee, on an ad hoc and informal basis, to maintain that solid appearance of stability.|$|E
25|$|Money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> {{increasingly}} became {{important to}} the wholesale money market {{leading up to the}} crisis.

40|$|In higher education, pure credit <b>market</b> <b>funding</b> {{leads to}} underinvestment due to {{insufficient}} risk pooling, while pure income-contingent loan funding leads to overinvestment.

In the absence of government intervention, we find that funding diversity improves pooling of individual income risks and, under some condition, leads to higher social welfare than pure credit <b>market</b> <b>funding.</b> If combined with a policy that restricts access to higher education, funding diversity even achieves full investment efficiency and strictly dominates credit <b>market</b> <b>funding...</b>|$|R

25|$|From the outset, money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> {{fell under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the SEC as they appeared to be more like investments (most similar to traditional stocks and bonds) vs. deposits and loans (cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers). Although money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator, the SEC, has zero mandate to control the supply of money, limit the overall extension of credit, mitigate against boom and bust cycles, etc. The SEC’s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk, and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets. After adequate disclosure, the SEC adopts a hands off, let the buyer beware attitude.|$|E
25|$|More debt {{securities}} meant more {{business for the}} Big Three agencies, which many investors depended on to judge the securities of the capital market.

25|$|Lastly, money <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> have {{diversification}} requirements, so {{that not}} more than 5% of assets may be from the same issuer. That is, a worst-case default would drop a fund {{not more than}} five percent. However, these rules {{do not apply to}} Fannie and Freddie. It would not be unusual to find a fund that had the vast majority of its assets in Fannie and Freddie debt.|$|E
25|$|The rating agencies' {{interest}} in pleasing the issuers of securities, who are their paying customers {{and benefit from}} high ratings, creates a conflict with their {{interest in}} providing accurate ratings of securities for investors buying the securities.
