50|$|The {{inclining test}} is usually done inshore in calm weather, in still water, {{and free of}} mooring {{restraints}} to achieve accuracy. The GM position is determined by <b>moving</b> <b>weights</b> transversely to produce a known overturning moment {{in the range of}} 1-4 degrees if possible. Knowing the restoring properties (buoyancy) of the vessel from its dimensions and floating position and measuring the equilibrium angle of the weighted vessel, the GM can be calculated.|$|E
50|$|Gravity also acts at a distance, {{without an}} {{apparent}} energy source, {{but to get}} energy out of a gravitational field (for instance, by dropping a heavy object, producing kinetic energy as it falls) one has to put energy in (for instance, by lifting the object up), and some energy is always dissipated in the process. A typical application of gravity in a perpetual motion machine is Bhaskara's wheel in the 12th century, whose key idea is itself a recurring theme, often called the overbalanced wheel: <b>moving</b> <b>weights</b> are attached to a wheel {{in such a way}} that they fall to a position further from the wheel's center for one half of the wheel's rotation, and closer to the center for the other half. Since weights further from the center apply a greater torque, it was thought that the wheel would rotate forever. However, since the side with weights further from the center has fewer weights than the other side, at that moment, the torque is balanced and perpetual movement is not achieved. The <b>moving</b> <b>weights</b> may be hammers on pivoted arms, or rolling balls, or mercury in tubes; the principle is the same.|$|E

50|$|Logging is a {{dangerous}} occupation. In the United States, it has consistently {{been one of the}} most hazardous industries. In 2008, the logging industry employed 86,000 workers, and accounted for 93 deaths. This resulted in a fatality rate of 108.1 deaths per 100,000 workers that year. This rate is over 30 times higher than the overall fatality rate. Loggers work with heavy, <b>moving</b> <b>weights,</b> and use tools such as chainsaws and heavy equipment on uneven and sometimes steep or unstable terrain. Loggers also deal with severe environmental conditions, such as inclement weather and severe heat or cold. An injured logger is often far from professional emergency treatment.|$|E

For example, a classical two-pan balance, with one weight for each power of 3, can weigh relatively heavy objects accurately {{with a small}} number of weights, by <b>moving</b> <b>weights</b> between the two pans and the table. For example, with weights for each power of 3 through 81, a 60-gram object (60dec = 1T1T0bal3) will be balanced perfectly with an 81 gram weight in the other pan, the 27 gram weight in its own pan, the 9 gram weight in the other pan, the 3 gram weight in its own pan, and the 1 gram weight set aside.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{efficient}} side information extrap-olation scheme with {{temporal and spatial}} consistency for low-delay Wyner-Ziv video coding. Our method {{is based on the}} regularized local linear regression (RLLR) model, in which each pixel in SI is approximated as a linear weighted com-bination of samples within a local temporal neighborhood. The optimal model parameters are estimated by projecting the transformation function onto the temporal training samples to exploit motion-related dependency. During this procedure, <b>moving</b> <b>weights</b> are incorporated into the objective function to express the relative importance of training samples in esti-mating parameters of the model. Furthermore, spatial corre-lation is explored by imposing an additional local smoothness penalty, which does good to estimate the occluded regions and complex motion regions. The learned function is smooth and locally linear, and can be obtained with a closed-form solu-tion by solving a convex optimization problem. Experimen-tal results demonstrate that the RLLR method achieves very competitive SI extrapolation performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to put forward a new {{hypothesis}} on the possible design of Johann Bessler’s self-turning wheel. I wish it were possible to actually reconstruct Bessler’s working designs. Unfortunately, they are forever lost to the past. Even if someone came up with a working model, based on all the clues and reports, we would still have no way of knowing, for sure, that the new design was the same, or similar to Bessler’s designs, except by inference. I am also aware, that many people around the world are trying to duplicate Bessler’s work. Like Bessler, I believe that the advent of the “self-turning wheel ” is a gift from God to everyone, and has the power to change the course of the future. I also believe that Bessler’s work belongs to history, and to all of humanity. So, another {{purpose of this}} article is to place in the public domain, certain information which I have gathered on this subject, which may be of interest to other researchers. Finally, it is common knowledge that no Patent Office on this planet will grant a patent on a Perpetual Motion Machine. This is an official bias that cannot be overcome within the patent system. Therefore, any working design cannot be legally protected for commercial purposes.

40|$|Adopting a {{statistical}} approach for the computation of turbulent combustion flows an approximation for the probability density function (PDF) {{of the composition}} variables is often required to treat the highly non-linear reaction term in a satisfactory way. Once class of methods currently being used are the moment methods which employ transport equations for low order statistical moments and use a parametrized shape of the PDF. A second class solves a transport equation for the joint PDF by a Monte Carlo method. In the present paper we develop an intermediate algorithm based on a Galerkin method for the PDF transport equation. The solution is developed {{in terms of an}} orthogonal or bi-orthogonal basis of a suitable Hilbert space. The unconventional use of the related weight function as a prefactor (<b>moving</b> <b>weight</b> approach) permits adaptivity and results in a generalization of the #beta#-closure for bounded scalar quantities. We present the approximation procedure in detail and apply it to the evolution of the composition in a homogeneous well-stirred reactor.
