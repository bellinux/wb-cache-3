40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of a mutant of Escherichia coli resistant to the antibiotic <b>mocimycin</b> is presented. This resistance is due to alterations in both tuf genes coding for the elongation factor Tu. <b>Mocimycin</b> resistance is recessive. Bacteria carryong only one tuf gene from the resistant mutant are still <b>mocimycin</b> sensitive. If the mutant gene is the tufA gene, the seisitive cells can be made resistant through inactivation of the tufB gene by insertion of the bacteriophage milliunits genome. Conditional mocimycin-resistant mutants ban also be isolated when the tufB gene is altered by an amber or a temperature-sensitive mutation. When only the tufB allele from the original mocimycin-resistant mutant is present, inactivation of the wild-type tufA gene fails to give viable mocimycin-resistant progeny. We conclude that the tufA mutant allele codes for a functional mocimycin-resistant EF-Tu, whereas the mutant tufB gene does not code for a functional product...|$|E
40|$|We {{constructed}} plasmids carrying tufA {{from which}} the major promoter for the rpsL-rpsG-fus-tufA operon (also called the str operon) had been removed. These plasmids continued to express tufA, as judged by the ability to complement <b>mocimycin</b> resistance and by electrophoretic analysis of synthesized proteins. Tn 5 transpositions into fus, the gene for elongation factor G, which lies immediately on the 5 ' side of tufA, failed to obstruct the expression of tufA. The subcloning of a 2, 000 -base-pair PstI-SmaI DNA fragment (containing the intercistronic region between tufA and fus, the distal portion of fus, and the proximal portion of tufA) next to promoterless tetracycline resistance genes (tet) yielded a plasmid that was capable of bestowing resistance to 12 microgram of tetracycline per ml. The removal of an EcoRI fragment that lies within fus destroyed {{the ability of the}} 2, 000 -base-pair PstI-SmaI fragment to promote the transcription of tet. These data indicate that, in addition to the operon's major promoter rpsLp, there is an internal promoter, tufAp, which can be used for the transcription of tufA, tufAp probably lies within fus, about 50 base pairs upstream from its 3 ' end and 120 base pairs from the start codon of tufA. The relative activities of tufB and of tufA-from-tufAp were estimated by a comparison of beta-galactosidase activities of almost identical EF-Tu-beta-galactosidase protein fusions; they were approximately equal...|$|E
